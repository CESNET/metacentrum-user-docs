title: My job failed with something like "No space left on device / Input-output error"

Typically this happens when:

- your job generates large output (.OU) or error (.ER) files into `/var/spool` directory, or 
- your job generates large temporary file(s) in `/tmp` directory.

Both `/var/spool` and `/tmp` directory are protected by a filesystem quota. On the affected node, your further jobs on the affected machine will not run until you remove the obtruding files.

**How to remove the files:**

1. login onto the affected machine, e.g. `$ ssh user_123@node_123.metacentrum.cz`
2. list the files in your filesystem quota: `$ check-local-quota`
3. inspect the files; if they contain valuable data, copy them to your home directory. After that remove them.
4. check local quota again; there should be no files left

**How to prevent the situation:**

If the files were placed in /tmp directory, add

```bash
export TMPDIR=$SCRATCHDIR
```

to the beginning of your batch script. Some applications use variable `TMPDIR` to store temporary files. If the value of `TMPDIR` is not defined, the files are stored in  system `/tmp` directory.

If the problem was caused by large `.OU` or `.ER` files, redirect them to /dev/null directory to a file in your scratch directory, e.g.

```bash
./your_application ..(options, input files etc)... 2> /dev/null    # redirect .ER to /dev/null
./your_application ..(options, input files etc)... > $SCRATCHDIR/  # redirect .OU to scratch directory
```
