title: Where can I find list of all installed software?
---
Currently an explicit list of all software is not included in this documentation.

In MetaCentrum software is organized in so-called *modules*. 

A primary tool to list all software is to [log in to a frontend]() and to type

```bash
module avail
```

or

```bash
module avail -t
```

The output of `module avail -t` looks like this:

![pic](/img/meta/support/faqs-content/list-all-sw-pic-001.png)

<Callout  type="info" title="Tip" icon="ðŸ’¡">
```bash
With this type of output, you can go forward a page by pressing Spacebar key.
```
</Callout>

To list all version of a selected software, use `module avail MODULE_NAME/`, e.g.:

![pic](/img/meta/support/faqs-content/list-all-sw-pic-002.png)

<Callout type="info">
```bash
You **have to** add the `/` at the end to see all versions.
```
</Callout>

Some selected software is provided via [Ondemand](), [related managed services]() and [containers](), too.
