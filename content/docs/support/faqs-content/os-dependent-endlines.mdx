title: qsub says "script contains cr, lf", what does this mean?
---
Described problem is caused by the fact that your batch script was written in non-Unix operational system (Windows) which uses different characters to mark end of a line.

To get rid of the faulty endlines, use `dos2unix` command:

```bash
(BUSTER)user123@skirit:~$ dos2unix myscriph.sh
```

To test for the type of endlines, use command `file`:

```bash
(BUSTER)user123@skirit:~$ file myscriph.sh
myscript.sh: UTF-8 Unicode text, with CRLF line terminators
```

If the `file` report `CRLF line terminators`, your script needs to be converted to run on Linux.
