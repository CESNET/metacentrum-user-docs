title: I get "permission denied" when I try to clean up scratch directory
---
The common confusion is that users try to remove the whole scratch directory

```bash
rm -rf $SCRATCHDIR
```

while they are allowed to remove only the *content* of the scratch directory:

```bash
rm -rf $SCRATCHDIR/*
```

The empty scratch directory will be removed automatically after some time.
