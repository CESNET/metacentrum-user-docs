title: How reliable/strong is the backup policy on storages?
---
Storage discs are backed up once a day (in the morning) by a form of snapshots to the same hardware.

This consequently:

- protects users to delete permanently data in their homes that are older than 24 hours
- the data created since the latest morning backup are not protected
- does not provide any protection from hardware failure, power outage, and natural disaster.

Users' homes on `storage` directories are meand to store temporary data (the ones user actively works with). Therefore the backup policy is mostly targeted at *unintentional user-side delete*. In other respects, the backup policy is pretty weak and the `storage` directories should not be used to store data of permanent value or data that are not eary to reproduce.
