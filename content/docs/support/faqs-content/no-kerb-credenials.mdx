title: I get "No Kerberos credentials found" error after submitting the script
---
You need a valid **Kerberos ticket (link do doku sekce Kerberos)**  to submit a job. Normally you ontain a Kerberos ticket when upon login to  a frontend. A ticket is valid for 10 hours. If the user stays logged in for longer time and Kerberos ticket expires meanwhile, the above-mentioned error message will appear.

To check for current Kerberos tickets, use `klist`.

To get a new Kerberos ticket, use `kinit`.
