title: I get "Disk quota exceeded" error during installation, how do I fix this?
---
Expanded, the error typically looks like this:

```bash
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded
```

Temporary files of various packages (installed via *pip*, *conda*, *mamba*, etc.) are often saved into `/tmp` directory (= outside of user's home).

The quota for writing outside of the scratch directory or user's home is very low (977 MB only) which causes the installation to fail.

**What to do:**

First check whether there are any files remaining in `/tmp`:

```bash
user_123@node:~$ check-local-quota
```

<Callout type="info">
```bash
Often no files in `/tmp` are found after failed installation. This is because most package managers try to clean up after themselves.
```
</Callout>

If there are any files found, remove them.

Secondly, redirect the variable `TMPDIR` as

```bash
user_123@node:~$ export TMPDIR=$SCRATCHDIR   
```

and re-run the installation.
