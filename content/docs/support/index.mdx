## How to write US request

The people in user support team are not omniscient. By keeping to several **dos** and **dont's** you can help them to localize your problem faster.

### Identify yourself

- Apart from your civil name, **always include your username** (login). 
- There may be more people with identical name/surname. 
- The username is unique.

### Describe the environment you work from

- Specify **job full ID**, **directory/frontend/node** you work from, which **modules** were loaded.
- Some applications can be run by several ways - e.g. loaded as a module or run as a Singularity image or as OnDemand alication.
- Always specify which way you used to run the software.

### Whenever possible, use copy-paste style

- Don't hesitate to **copy-paste error messages** into your request.
- The same applies for describing your own actions - just **paste the string of commands** you typed.
- If the error message is too long, include it in a separate file.
- Writing something like "program XY has problem with library YY" does not help us much. 
- Where is the library? What problem exactly? We need to see details.

### Write a descriptive subject

- Describe in the subject **what you observe at current point**. 
- Be specific.
- Use formulations like "Ansys fails right after start" rather than "Problem with Ansys", or "I need help with installing XY by Conda" rather than "Question about installation".

### Tell us which parts of documentation you searched through

- Often our first action is to navigate user to a certain section of documentation. 
- If **you have already read through the documentation** and it did not help solve your issue, tell us about this!
- Plus, it is the good feedback for us that the documentation is possibly not quite clear and/or complete.

### Tell us also what worked

- If you have a slightly alternate **example that did work**, tell us about it.
- E.g. if the job runs OK on some cluster, but fails on another; if it runs on one CPU, but fails on two or more... you get it.
 
### If possible, prepare a smallest possible example how to reproduce the issue

- If you have already investigated the problem on your own, you might have **some reduced example how to reproduce the failure**.
- Attach this example or a link to a directory where we can find it. 

### Don't send your request to staff members directly

- Always send requests to **meta@cesnet.cz** instead of staff members directly.
- The emails sent to meta@cesnet.cz are visible to all members of user support and will be picked up by the correct specialist.
- Many staff members work only part time at US desk and may have day-offs.
- And we are sometimes sick or on holidays, too.

### New problem, new request

- For **new issues unrelated to your previous one**, write a **new request**.
- Do not respond to your latest email from user support - this will reopen your old ticket.

### Tell us also about what you finally need to achieve

- If you **struggle with Y** but really **what you are after is X**, please also **tell us about X**.

- Aka avoid *The XY problem*:
    - User wants to do X.
    - User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can do it if they can just manage to do Y.
    - User doesn't know how to do Y either.
    - User asks for help with Y.
    - Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
    - After much interaction, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.
