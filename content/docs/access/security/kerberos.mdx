title: Kerberos
---
[Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)) is a single sign-on system. Installing Kerberos on your PC means you don't have to fill in your password with every login attempt. You login only once, the Kerberos server issue a ticket which is stored in your computer. During the validity of the ticket you can log in to every frontend, compute node or storage without entering a password. 

## Linux

### Install Kerberos

On Ubuntu or other Debian-like system, you can install Kerberos using apt command.

```
# update repositories and upgrade your system (recommended)
# you will need to enter your root password to your computer (because sudo)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# install kerberos
# package ssh-krb5 may not be necessary
sudo apt install krb5-user ssh-krb5
```

You can skip the configuration graphical wizard (click on Ok, Next, ...), the  environment can be set up later.

On Mac, Kerberos is available as part of the MacOS.

### Download the configuration file

Copy up-to-date Kerberos's config file from any frontend. For example:

    sudo scp user123@skirit.ics.muni.cz:/etc/krb5.conf /etc/

<Callout type="info">
    MacOS users: The location of the configuration file is different than the traditional Linux location. Instead of `/etc/krb5.conf`, the Kerberos configuration file is located in `/Library/Preferences/edu.mit.kerberos`, which follows more closely the naming conventions in Mac OS X.
</Callout>

### Configure SSH

Open the `~/.ssh/config` file in any text editor and set several GSSAPI values to `yes`:

    nano ~/.ssh/config

The  following lines have to be added to the configuration file:

```
# Kerberos access (Metacentrum)
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
GSSAPIKeyExchange yes         # MacOS users: leave out this line!
```

You can also make the change of SSH client configuration in a file `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, it affects settings of all users on your system.

### Usage

Run these commands:

```
# obtain ticket from Kerberos server
# You will be asked to fill in password
kinit user123@META 

# check valid tickets
klist
```

You should get an output similar to this one:

```
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000
Default principal: user123@META

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
05/26/21 17:48:19  05/27/21 17:48:17  krbtgt/META@META
```

It means that you have valid ticket for 24 hours to META (Metacentrum).

You can get a ticket with renew ability (maximum time in Metacentrum is 7 days):

```
# You will be asked to fill in password
kinit -r 7d META_USERNAME@META
```

Now, You can log in to any node by command e.g.:

    ssh user123@skirit.ics.muni.cz

    If you cannot login try running command `ntpdate tik.cesnet.cz` to synchronize clock.

**Edit kr5.ini file**

Download/copy the `/etc/krb5.conf` from any frontend and save it to `C:\ProgramData\MIT\Kerberos5\krb5.ini` (you need administrative privileges to do so).

<Callout  type="info" title="Tip" icon="ðŸ’¡">
    Save the file as "krb5.ini" with quotation marks to force .ini file extension
</Callout>

### Usage
