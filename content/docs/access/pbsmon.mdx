<Callout type="info" title="PBSmon is optional tool for Metacentrum users">
    **PBSmon is not necessary for logging in**, neither it is essential for full-featured usage of Metacentrum grid services. In principle all information displayed by PBSmon can be obtained through commandline interface. Similarly, all tasks connected with account management can be conducted via the [Perun user management system](https://perun.e-infra.cz/login). If you are new to Metacentrum, you can skip exploring the PBSmon service for now; later, as the list and complexity of your jobs grows, you will probably find it more useful.

## Live data - jobs, queues, nodes

**Live data** concerning current state of jobs, queues, nodes and physical machines can be found under the [Current state](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/state/index.html) tab.

## qsub assembler

**An interactive PBS parameter selection tool** (shortly as **qsub assembler**) can be found under the  [Current state -> Qsub assembler](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/qsub_pbspro) tab.

Using this tool, users can assemble a set of parameters required for their job and see which machines match to their selection criteria and how busy the nodes are at the moment. Additionally, they get a line of the qsub command in correct syntax that can be used in a copy-and-paste way.

## News and outages

**Planned changes** in MetaCentrum infrastructure, such as PBS parameters changes, new hardware, planned shutdowns, are listed under the [Current affairs -> News](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/news/news.jsp) tab.
