[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) is a **web-based** solution for handling **large scientific datasets**, their computational processing, and tracking through the **provenance** of secondary datasets.

![pic-landing](/img/meta/galaxy/usegalaxy-landing-page.png)

Having originated in the bioinformatics community, Galaxy spans numerous scientific disciplines (ecology, chemistry, NLP, climate science, social sciences, …). Nowadays, thousands of computational tools are available, supported by dozens of scientific and software development teams.

The user community is worldwide, with main installations in the US, EU, and Australia, complemented with a network of national installations (usegalaxy.*).

The Czech national service [usegalaxy.cz](https://usegalaxy.cz) is provided by [e-INFRA CZ](https://e-infra.cz) / [MetaCentrum](https://metacentrum.cz) together with [Elixir CZ](https://www.elixir-czech.cz).

It **mirrors the toolset of the global public instances** [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org), [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)) with **much larger quotas for Czech researchers** and their collaborators.



## Accessing usegalaxy.cz

Web interface: https://usegalaxy.cz

![pic-login](/img/meta/galaxy/login-galaxy.png)


| Option    | Who can use it     | How to log in         | Typical quota       |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **MetaCentrum account**       | Anyone with a valid MetaCentrum account (see below) | Use the e-INFRA CZ AAI Login | 200 GB storage, 10 concurrent jobs   |
| **Life‑Science Login (ELIXIR AAI)** | Users registered in the [ELIXIR/Life‑Science](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/users/how-to-get-and-use-life-science-id.html) federated identity system | Click **Life Science Login** on the Galaxy login page | 50 GB storage, 10 concurrent jobs  |

### How to obtain a MetaCentrum account 
* Go to the [MetaCentrum application form](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/application/index.html) 
* Sign in via credentials from your institution (Czech academia)
* Follow the instructions

### Linking your identities (recommended)

<Callout type="info">
Tip: If you have both identities, link them in Galaxy. This prevents “missing data” problems when switching between log-ins.
</Callout>


1. Click on *User* in the top menu
2. Select *Preferences*.
3. Select *Manage Third-Party Identities*.
4. Choose the other identity provider and authenticate yourself.

## Using usegalaxy.cz

### User Quotas

| Resource                  | Limit (standard)                          | How to request more                                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Storage**               | 200 GB (MetaCentrum / E‑infra AAI)<br/>50 GB (Life‑Science Login)        | Send a request to **galaxy@cesnet.cz** with a short<br/>description of your needs.      |
| **Concurrent jobs**       | 10 jobs per user (default)                | Same e‑mail address – we can raise the limit<br/> for large projects.        |
| **Maximum single dataset**| 50 GB                                      | Split large files or ask for a temporary increase.            |

If your research requires more storage, please reach out to us at galaxy@cesnet.cz with a description of your needs. All quota changes are evaluated case‑by‑case.


### FTP Upload – Step‑by‑Step

Because Galaxy’s federated log‑ins don’t provide an FTP password out of the box, you need to create one first.
Additional steps are required in order to obtain a password for your FTP access:

1. Log in to [usegalaxy.cz](https://usegalaxy.cz) using one of the federated login options. At this point, you don't have an FTP password yet.
2. Log out of Galaxy and go to the [Galaxy login](https://usegalaxy.cz/login/) panel and enter your registered email address into the username field.
3. Click on the `Click here to reset your password` button.
4. You will receive an email with the reset password link. Check your spam folder if necessary.
5. Click on the provided link and set up a new password for your FTP access.
6. Once you have set a new password, you can use your registered email address and the new password to log in to our ftp server at `usegalaxy.cz` and copy your files there.
7. Follow the data import process described in the [docs](https://galaxyproject.org/ftp-upload/).

<Callout type="info">
Note: The FTP password you set does not affect your Galaxy web login. Keep it safe, but you can reset it at any time via the same password-reset procedure.
