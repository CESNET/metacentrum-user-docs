[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) is a web-based platform designed for running computational and statistical analyses with focus on openness and usage of FAIR data. It originally started in biomedical science but nowadays spans numerous scientific domains including ecology, natural language processing, chemistry, climate science, and social sciences.

There is worldwide network of Galaxy servers providing open access to virtually all academic users
consisting of "copies" (instances) of the service. Some major ones are hosted in the [United States](https://usegalaxy.org), [EU](https://usegalaxy.eu), and [Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au).
Besides, [numerous specialized services](https://galaxyproject.org/use/) exist.

Many quickstart and advanced tutorials are available on [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/).

Metacentrum currently maintains 3 independent Galaxy servers: [usegalaxy.cz](#usegalaxycz), [RepeatExplorer](#repeatexplorer), and [UMSA](#umsa).

## UMSA

This Galaxy instance provides tools for Untargeted Mass Spectrometry Analysis and we maintain it for our partners at [RECETOX](https://www.recetox.muni.cz/en).

UMSA Galaxy environment is available at [https://galaxy-umsa.grid.cesnet.cz/](https://galaxy-umsa.grid.cesnet.cz/).

### FTP Access

You can load files into this Galaxy using FTP. However due to the nature of federated login additional steps are required in order to obtain password for your FTP access:

1. Log in to galaxy-umsa.grid.cesnet.cz using one of the federated login options. At this point you don't have an FTP password yet.
2. Log out of Galaxy and go to the [Galaxy login](https://galaxy-umsa.grid.cesnet.cz/login/) panel and enter your registered email address into the username field.
3. Click on the `Click here to reset your password` button.
4. You will receive an email with the reset password link. Check your spam folder if necessary.
5. Click on the provided link and set up a new password for your FTP access.
6. Once you have set a new password, you can use your registered email address and the new password to log in to our ftp server at `galaxy-umsa.grid.cesnet.cz` and copy your files there.
7. Follow the data import process described in the [docs](https://galaxyproject.org/ftp-upload/).
