[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) is a web-based platform designed for running computational and statistical analyses with focus on openness and usage of FAIR data. It originally started in biomedical science but nowadays spans numerous scientific domains including ecology, natural language processing, chemistry, climate science, and social sciences.

There are many Galaxy servers providing open access to virtually all academic users hosted by various institutions around the world. Some major ones are in the [USA](https://usegalaxy.org), [EU](https://usegalaxy.eu), and [Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au).
Besides, [numerous specialized services](https://galaxyproject.org/use/) exist.

In addition to the usegalaxy.cz Metacentrum also maintains the specialized [RepeatExplorer](../related/galaxy/repeat_explorer) Galaxy instance which is open worldwide thanks to the funding from ELIXIR Europe. And last, for the group at [RECETOX](https://www.recetox.muni.cz/en), we run the Untargeted Mass Spetrometry Analysis Galaxy server -- [UMSA](../related/galaxy/umsa).

If you need any help or experience tool errors or have unexpected issues with any of the Galaxy instance above please contact us at galaxy@cesnet.cz.
