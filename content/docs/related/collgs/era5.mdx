*[ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5) is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1940 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF.*

ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables.

The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km.

ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.

ERA5 is available on:

- Single levels
- Pressure levels: 1000/975/950/925/900/875/850/825/800/775/750/700/650/600/550/500/450/400/350/300/250/225/200/175/150/125/100/70/50/30/20/10/7/5/3/2/1

## Redistribution of ERA5 Data

As part of the ERA5 data distribution, users are provided with the datasets [ERA5 hourly data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) and [ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview). These redistributed datasets cover the entire territory of the Czech Republic, specified by the bounding box [48.48, 12.07, 51.08, 19.00](http://bboxfinder.com/#48.480000,12.070000,51.080000,19.00000).

As of today (November 7, 2023), data from October 2023 to August 2018 have been downloaded, and older data is still being downloaded, up to the first available month of January 1940.

The list of variables included in the datasets is available at the following pages:

- [ERA5 reanalysis-single-levels variables](./ERA5_reanalysis-era5-single-levels_variables)
- [ERA5 reanalysis-pressure-levels variables](./ERA5_reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels_variables)

The data is available to the public without the need for registration via the STAC catalog at the following addresses:

- [https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-single-levels](https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-single-levels)
- [https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels](https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels)

The data is not prepared for specific user queries but is pre-processed. For each available month of the considered dataset, four product types are available:

- Reanalysis
- Ensemble mean
- Ensemble members
- Ensemble spread

According to the data specification, they can be further modified and adjusted up to three months retrospectively.

To reflect this, data is now downloaded up to the end of the month preceding the current month. For example, in November, the last downloaded month will be October. However, it should be noted that this data may still change.

Additionally, the data undergoes an update and finalization process, where the data for the current month is downloaded along with the final data for the previous four months after the 2nd day of the current month. For example, in November, final data for July will be downloaded.

## Download Procedure

Data for each considered dataset and product type are distributed in `.grib` format and contain complete hourly data for all available variables of the considered month. For the `reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels` dataset, data is also available for all pressure levels.

Individual months are organized in a flat structure:

`/collections/reanalysis-era5-single-levels/items/YYYY-MM-reanalysis-era5-single-levels`

This API endpoint returns the GeoJSON of the given item, with the *assets* node being significant for downloading the data.

The *assets* node consists of four additional nodes, corresponding to the individual product types:

- reanalysis
- ensemble-mean
- ensemble-members
- ensemble-spread

Each of these product-type nodes contains an `href` key that points to the desired `.grib` file.
