title: ERA5
---

*[ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5) is the fifth-generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate, produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). It covers the period from January 1940 to present and provides hourly estimates of a wide range of atmospheric, land, and oceanic variables. ERA5 is available on a 30 km grid and is available up to heihgt of 80 km. ERA5 includes uncertainty estimates at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions and is available in three main dataset.*

## Available Datasets

### 1. ERA5 Hourly Data on Single Levels
Provides surface and near-surface variables (e.g., temperature at 2 m, surface pressure, total precipitation).

- Grid resolution: cca. 30 km (0,25° x 0,25° grid)
- Vertical levels: Single level (surface)
- Coverage: near-surface
- [Dataset on ECMWF website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels)
- STAC: [https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-single-levels](https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-single-levels)
- [Variables list](./ERA5_reanalysis-era5-single-levels_variables)

### 2. ERA5 Hourly Data on Pressure Levels
Provides data on standard atmospheric pressure levels (e.g., temperature, wind, humidity).

- Grid resolution: cca. 30 km (0,25° x 0,25° grid)
- Coverage: vertical on pressure levels from 1 hPa to 1 000 hPa
- [Dataset on ECMWF website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels)
- STAC: [https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels](https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels)
- [Variables list](./ERA5_reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels_variables)

### 3. ERA5-Land
A land-surface-focused dataset providing improved resolution and accuracy over land areas by re-running the ERA5 land component. It contains quanitites such as soil moisture & temperature, snow depth, evaporation, runoff, etc.

- Grid resolution: cca. 9 km (0,1° x 0,1° grid)
- Coverage: Land surfaces only
- Temporal coverage: From January 1950 to present
- [Dataset on ECMWF website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land)
- STAC: [https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-land](https://stac.cesnet.cz/collections/reanalysis-era5-land)

## Data Redistribution

Redistributed ECMWF datasets are available for the **Czech Republic** national teritory and border areas of neighboring countries, covering the bounding box [48.48, 12.07, 51.08, 19.00](http://bboxfinder.com/#48.480000,12.070000,51.080000,19.00000).

As of **April 11, 2024**, data from **January 2020 to May 2024** has been downloaded, with newer as well as older data still being downloaded and processed back to the earliest available month of each respective dataset.


## Data Availability and Update Policy

Each dataset is provided as complete monthly `.grib` files, organized in STAC catalog by `collection` and `item` in hierarchical structure:

```
/collections/<dataset-name>/items/YYYY-MM-<dataset-name>
```

NetCDF format is as of today considered **experimental** by ECMWF and thus it is not being currently downloaded. `href`s to these files are set as `null`!

Datasets for reanalysis on single levels and pressure levels includes **four product types**:

- Reanalysis
- Ensemble mean
- Ensemble members
- Ensemble spread

ERA-5 land includes only **Reanalysis** product type.

According to ECMWF documentation, ERA5 data can be re-processed retrospectively for up to three months. Therefore:

- **New monthly data** is downloaded up to the **end of the previous month**.
- **Finalized data** is re-downloaded for the **four months prior**, typically after the 2nd day of the current month.

For example, in **November**, data from **October** is added, and finalized data for **July** is refreshed.

## Downloading Data

Each STAC API item returns a **GeoJSON** with an `assets` node, containing direct `.grib` links for each product type:

```json
"assets": {
"reanalysis-grib": { "href": "..." },
"ensemble-mean-grib": { "href": "..." },
"ensemble-members-grib": { "href": "..." },
"ensemble-spread-grib": { "href": "..." },
"reanalysis-netcdf": { "href": null },
"ensemble-mean-netcdf": { "href": null },
"ensemble-members-netcdf": { "href": null },
"ensemble-spread-netcdf": { "href": null }
}
```
