<Callout type="alert" title="New service available" icon="🛰️">
CESNET association is extending its collaboration with ESA, therefore, there is a new generation of th CollGS service prepared. To access and use the service, you will need to log in through AAI e-INFRA CZ, where a new virtual organization Collgs-CZ is established.

By registering, you will not only gain access to the CollGS.CZ service, but you will also have the opportunity to gain access
to other services of the large research infrastructure e-INFRA CZ designed for the research community.

**In April 2025, both systems will be accessible simultaneously, in May 2025 GSS will fully replace it.**

You can sign up here: https://signup.e-infra.cz/anyfed/registrar/registrar/?vo=VO_collgs_cz.

Current users will be informed about this change by email.
</Callout>

CESNET operates the Czech national node of the European Space Agency's (ESA) initiative [Sentinel Collaborative Ground Segment](http://collgs.czechspaceportal.cz).  

Sentinel satellites are the backbone and primary data source of the European Earth observation program [Copernicus](http://copernicus.gov.cz).  

The national hub serves for storing and distributing Sentinel data covering the territory of the Czech Republic.

In addition to Sentinel data, we also provide access to datasets from Landsat and ERA5, each detailed on separate pages in this documentation.

Access to the data is free for all users.  

Depending on the nature of data processing and subsequent usage, CESNET can also offer supplementary services such as computing or storage capacities.

## Registration and Account Management  

For accessing Sentinel data, you first need to register.

The registration form will appear upon your first login to the GSS (Gael Store Service) system, if you have not registered already using the direct [link](https://signup.e-infra.cz/anyfed/registrar/registrar/?vo=VO_collgs_cz).  

After completing the form, the system will send you an email, through which you can confirm your registration.  

Once successfully registered, you can access the data of the national hub.

Possible methods of accessing the data are described on the page about [accessing Sentinel satellite data](./collgs/sentinel/sentinel/).

For any account-related actions that you cannot perform yourself, please contact collgs@cesnet.cz.
