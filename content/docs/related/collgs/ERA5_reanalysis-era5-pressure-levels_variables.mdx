| Name | Unit | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Divergence | s-1 | This parameter is the horizontal divergence of velocity. It is the rate at which air is spreading out horizontally from a point, per square metre. This parameter is positive for air that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for air that is concentrating, or converging (convergence).|
| Fraction of cloud cover | Dimensionless | This parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud (liquid or ice) and varies between zero and one. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.|
| Geopotential | m2 s-2 | This parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location, relative to mean sea level. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2). The geopotential height plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns). Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones, anticyclones, troughs and ridges. At the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.|
| Ozone mass mixing ratio | kg kg-1 | This parameter is the mass of ozone per kilogram of air. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms. Most of the IFS chemical species are archived as mass mixing ratios [kg kg-1].|
| Potential vorticity | K m2 kg-1 s-1 | Potential vorticity is a measure of the capacity for air to rotate in the atmosphere. If we ignore the effects of heating and friction, potential vorticity is conserved following an air parcel. It is used to look for places where large wind storms are likely to originate and develop. Potential vorticity increases strongly above the tropopause and therefore, it can also be used in studies related to the stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere exchanges. Large wind storms develop when a column of air in the atmosphere starts to rotate. Potential vorticity is calculated from the wind, temperature and pressure across a column of air in the atmosphere.|
| Relative humidity | % | This parameter is the water vapour pressure as a percentage of the value at which the air becomes saturated (the point at which water vapour begins to condense into liquid water or deposition into ice). For temperatures over 0�C (273.15 K) it is calculated for saturation over water. At temperatures below -23�C it is calculated for saturation over ice. Between -23�C and 0�C this parameter is calculated by interpolating between the ice and water values using a quadratic function.|
| Specific cloud ice water content | kg kg-1 | This parameter is the mass of cloud ice particles per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two. Note that 'cloud frozen water' is the same as 'cloud ice water'.|
| Specific cloud liquid water content | kg kg-1 | This parameter is the mass of cloud liquid water droplets per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two.|
| Specific humidity | kg kg-1 | This parameter is the mass of water vapour per kilogram of moist air. The total mass of moist air is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow.|
| Specific rain water content | kg kg-1 | The mass of water produced from large-scale clouds that is of raindrop size and so can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. The quantity is expressed in kilograms per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles. The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.|
| Specific snow water content | kg kg-1 | The mass of snow (aggregated ice crystals) produced from large-scale clouds that can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. The mass is expressed in kilograms per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles. The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.|
| Temperature | K | This parameter is the temperature in the atmosphere. It has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (�C) by subtracting 273.15. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.|
| U-component of wind | m s-1 | This parameter is the eastward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the west. This parameter can be combined with the V component of wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal wind.|
| V-component of wind | m s-1 | This parameter is the northward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the south. This parameter can be combined with the U component of wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal wind.|
| Vertical velocity | Pa s-1 | This parameter is the speed of air motion in the upward or downward direction. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) uses a pressure based vertical co-ordinate system and pressure decreases with height, therefore negative values of vertical velocity indicate upward motion. Vertical velocity can be useful to understand the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere, including areas of upward motion/ascent (negative values) and downward motion/subsidence (positive values).|
| Vorticity (relative) | s-1 | This parameter is a measure of the rotation of air in the horizontal, around a vertical axis, relative to a fixed point on the surface of the Earth. On the scale of weather systems, troughs (weather features that can include rain) are associated with anticlockwise rotation (in the northern hemisphere), and ridges (weather features that bring light or still winds) are associated with clockwise rotation. Adding the effect of rotation of the Earth, the Coriolis parameter, to the relative vorticity produces the absolute vorticity."|
