[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) is a web-based platform designed for running computational and statistical analyses with focus on openness and usage of FAIR data. It originally started in biomedical science but nowadays spans numerous scientific domains including ecology, natural language processing, chemistry, climate science, and social sciences.

There is worldwide network of Galaxy servers providing open access to virtually all academic users
consisting of "copies" (instances) of the service. Some major ones are hosted in the [United States](https://usegalaxy.org), [EU](https://usegalaxy.eu), and [Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au).
Besides, [numerous specialized services](https://galaxyproject.org/use/) exist.

Many quickstart and advanced tutorials are available on [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/).

Metacentrum currently maintains 3 independent Galaxy servers: [usegalaxy.cz](#usegalaxycz), [RepeatExplorer](#repeatexplorer), and [UMSA](#umsa).

## usegalaxy.cz

[E-infraCZ](https://e-infra.cz) / [Metacentrum](https://metacentrum.cz) together with [Elixir CZ](https://www.elixir-czech.cz)
provide the [usegalaxy.cz](https://usegalaxy.cz) service.
It aims at replicating the functionality (set of available tools in particular) of the worldwide services ([usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org), [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu))
while offering significantly higher user quotas (both computational and storage) to the registered CZ users and their collaborators.

### Federated Login Options

Metacentrum Galaxy provides two convenient options for logging in:

1. **[E-infra AAI](https://aai.cesnet.cz)**
which is the prefered way for CZ academic users and it grants higher computing and storage quotas automatically.
2. **[Life Science Login](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login.html)** If you are associated with the LifeScience/Elixir, you can log in using LifeScience AAI.
This is the same method used by [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) and it grants access to the same set of users, with restricted quotas, though.

CZ users, who are able to use E-infra AAI, are able to also log in with Life Science Login in most cases, and they
are advised to link them together in Galaxy to avoid future confusion (e.g. not being able to access results stored previously).

The following procedure links the identities:

1. Click on *User* in the top menu
2. Select *Preferences*.
3. Select *Manage Third-Party Identities*.
4. Choose the other identity provider and authenticate yourself.

### User Quotas

The Czech national usegalaxy server at usegalaxy.cz offers **200 GB** of free storage quota to users logging in through [E-infra AAI](https://aai.cesnet.cz) or **50GB** to the users with [Life Science Login](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login.html). If your research requires more storage please reach us at regalaxy@rt.cesnet.cz with description of your needs.

There is also a limit on the number of jobs a given user can have running concurrently. The usegalaxy.cz instance has this limit set at **10 jobs** at the moment. Again, please reach out if this is not sufficient for your needs.

Maximum size of a single dataset is limited at 50 GB.

### FTP Access

You can load files into Galaxy using FTP. However due to the nature of federated login additional steps are required in order to obtain password for your FTP access:

1. Log in to usegalaxy.cz using one of the federated login options. At this point you don't have an FTP password yet.
2. Log out of Galaxy and go to the [Galaxy login](https://usegalaxy.cz/login/) panel and enter your registered email address into the username field.
3. Click on the `Click here to reset your password` button.
4. You will receive an email with the reset password link. Check your spam folder if necessary.
5. Click on the provided link and set up a new password for your FTP access.
6. Once you have set a new password, you can use your registered email address and the new password to log in to our ftp server at `usegalaxy.cz` and copy your files there.
7. Follow the data import process described in the [docs](https://galaxyproject.org/ftp-upload/).

## RepeatExplorer

RepeatExplorer is a domain specific Galaxy instance which includes utilities for graph-based clustering and characterization of repetitive sequences in next-generation sequencing data and tools for the detection of transposable element protein coding domains.

We maintain this Galaxy for our partners at [Institute of Plant Molecular Biology](https://www.umbr.cas.cz/en/).

RepeatExplorer Galaxy environment is available at [https://repeatexplorer-elixir.cerit-sc.cz/galaxy/](https://repeatexplorer-elixir.cerit-sc.cz/galaxy/).

### Registration

1. Visit [registration url](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/osobniv3/wayf/elixir.jsp)
2. Select account that you will use for registration
    - If you have access to eduIDcz identity (Czech academia) prefer that.
    - Otherwise use Elixir/LS Login or other identity provider from the list
3. Log in to your selected account and agree when asked to share information with Perun
4. *(optional)* if similar user already exists in Perun, you will be asked to prove your identity by
logging into this existing account – do this only in case that you want to use this
account and it is truly yours (you have to provide correct username and password for
this account). If you don’t want to use your already existing account or similar user
that Perun found is not you, you can click on the button ”It is not me”.
5. Please fill the presented application form for Elixir CZ IT services.
6. Next you will see form to choose username and password for RepeatExplorer Galaxy. If you have chosen to use your already existing account during previous steps these fields will be pre-filled.
7. Congratulation, you are successfully registered! If you have changed your email address during registration,
you will have to verify it. Please check your inbox.
8. Please expect up to 30m propagation delay before you'll be able to log in to Galaxy.

### User Quotas

The RepeatExplorer Galaxy server offers **200 GB** of free storage quota to any registered user. If your research requires more storage please reach us at regalaxy@rt.cesnet.cz with description of your needs.

There is also a limit on the number of jobs a given user can have running concurrently. The RepeatExplorer instance has this limit set at **5 jobs** at the moment. Again, please reach is if this is not sufficient for your needs.

Maximum size of a single dataset is limited at 250 GB.

### FTP Access

RepeatExplorer's FTP server runs at `repeatexplorer-elixir.cerit-sc.cz` on `port 990` and uses the same username and password as RepeatExplorer Galaxy itself.

To learn how to connect to the server and import data to your history please follow the process described in the [docs](https://galaxyproject.org/ftp-upload/).

## Data Storage Reliability

Data storage of *all our Galaxy instances* is resilient to normal disk failures and common consistency problems
(e.g. power outages). However all users are advised to back up their high-value data elsewhere.

## Contact & Help

If you need any help or experience tool errors or have unexpected issues with any of the Galaxy instance above please contact us at regalaxy@rt.cesnet.cz.
