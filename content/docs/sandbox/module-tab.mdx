| perl-svg | Perl extension for generating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) documents.  |
| perl-sys-sigaction | Prior to version 5.8.0 perl implemented 'unsafe' signal handling. The reason it is consider unsafe, is that there is a risk that a signal will arrive, and be handled while perl is changing internal data structures. This can result in all kinds of subtle and not so subtle problems. For this reason it has always been recommended that one do as little as possible in a signal handler, and only variables that already exist be manipulated. |

It can be useful to use this module as a base class so you don't have to, for example, implement the characters() callback. |
| perl-xml-sax-writer | A new XML Writer was needed to match the SAX2 effort because quite naturally no existing writer understood SAX2. My first intention had been to start patching XML::Handler::YAWriter as it had previously been my favourite writer in the SAX1 world. |

| zip | Zip is a compression and file packaging/archive utility. |
| zlib | A free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered lossless data-compression library. |
| zoltan | The Zoltan library is a toolkit of parallel combinatorial algorithms for parallel, unstructured, and/or adaptive scientific applications. Zoltan's largest component is a suite of dynamic load-balancing and partitioning algorithms that increase applications' parallel performance by reducing idle time. Zoltan also has graph coloring and graph ordering algorithms, which are useful in task schedulers and parallel preconditioners. |
| zstd | Zstandard, or zstd as short version, is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios. |
| zziplib | The zziplib provides read access to zipped files in a zip-archive, using compression based solely on free algorithms provided by zlib. It also provides a functionality to overlay the archive filesystem with the filesystem of the operating system environment. |
