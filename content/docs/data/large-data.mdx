## Useful commands 

### `scp`

scp works in pretty much the same way as normal `cp`, only it allows you to copy files between different machines.

```bash
user123@home_PC:~$ scp -r my_dir user123@skirit.metacentrum.cz: # copy directory "my_dir" from user's PC to a home directory on skirit
user123@home_PC:~$ scp -r user123@skirit.metacentrum.cz:~/results . # from user123's home on skirit, copy to user123's PC folder "results" 
```

### `wget`

Alternative way to download data is a `wget` command. `wget` will work only if the **file is available via ftp or http(s) protocols**, typically when it is a downloadable file on some server. `wget` is faster and less safe than `scp`, so it may be a method of choice if you need to download larger amount of data from a server where privacy is not an issue.

```bash
ssh user123@skirit.metacentrum.cz # login to a frontend
user123@skirit.metacentrum.cz:~$ mkdir data && cd data 
user123@skirit.metacentrum.cz:~/data$ wget https://www.someServer.org/someData.zip # download file someData.zip from server https://www.someServer.org
```

Using `wget` you can only transfer data **to** Metacentrum machines.

`wget` is of no use if you want to transfer **from** Metacentrum.

### `sftp`

sftp is just another protocol for data transfer. Contrary to `scp` it is **interactive** and apart from copying it also enables the user to manipulate files and directories on the remote side. We recommend to use `scp` if you need only to copy the data.

<Callout type="warn" title="Windows users alert">
Windows users need an SFTP client, we recommend the WinSCP application. Keep in mind you have to fill in as target chosen NFS4 server instead of frontend in Step 1. Make sure you have selected SFTP file protocol, too.
</Callout>

1.    `sftp user123@target_NFS4_server` # Login
2.    `help` List available commands
3.    `get target_file` Download target file to your local system
4.    `get -r target_directory` Download target directory to your local system
5.    `put target_file` Upload target file to server
6.    `put -r target_directory` Upload target directory to server

<Callout type="info" title="Bug">
There is a bug affecting Ubuntu 14.04+ concerning the recursive copy command. If `put -r` fails, create the target directory on the server first to work around this issue.

### `rsync`

The `rsync` command is a more advanced and versatile copying tool. It enables the user to synchronize the content of two directories in a more efficient way than scp, because `rsync` copies only the differences between the directories. Therefore it is often used as a tool for regular backups.

**Examples**

Copy directory data to archive:

```bash
$ rsync -zvh /storage/brno2/home/user123/data /storage/du-cesnet/home/user123/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape
```

Copy only the content of directory data to archive:

```bash
$ rsync -zvh /storage/brno2/home/user123/data/ /storage/du-cesnet/home/user123/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape
```

### `tar`

`tar` (tape archiver) command enables to pack files and directories into one archive file. `tar` by itself does not compress the size of the files, and the resulting volume of the packed archive is roughly the same as the sum of the volumes of individual files.

`tar` is often used together with commands for file compression like `gzip`.

**Examples**

In `/storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive`, create uncompressed archive of the directory `~/my-archive`:

```bash
tar cvf /storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive/my-archive.tgz ~/my-archive
```

In `/storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive`, create archive of the directory `~/my-archive` and compress it by `gzip` command:

```bash
tar czvf /storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive/my-archive.tgz ~/my-archive
```

List the content of the existing archive:

```bash
tar tzf /storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive/my-archive.tgz
```

Unpack the *whole* archive `my-archive.tgz` residing in `storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive/` into current directory:

```bash
tar xzvf /storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive/my-archive.tgz
```

Unpack *part* of the archive:

```bash
tar tzf /storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive/my-archive.tgz # list the content of the archive
# unpack only file PATH1/file1 and directory PATH2/dir2 into the current directory
tar xzvf /storage/du-cesnet/home/USER/VO_metacentrum-tape_tape-archive/my-archive.tgz "PATH1/file1" "PATH2/dir2"
```

There are many other options to customize the tar command. For the full description, read manual pages (`man tar`). 

## Moderate data handling

This chapter provides basic guides on data manipulation within MetaCentrum infrastructure.

When dealing with data, the most important criteria is the **total volume**/**number of files** that are to be moved in a single operation.

As a rule of thumb,

- moderate data is up to **500 individual files** AND up to **50 GB** of total size,
- large data is more than any of that.


A default way to manipulate moderate data is to work through the frontend.

Example:
```bash
local_user@home_PC:~$ scp MetaUser123@skirit.ics.muni.cz:/storage/brno2/home/user123/foo . # copy file "foo" from brno2 storage through the skirit frontend to a local PC
```
![Copy data to storage through frontend](/img/meta/data/cp-data-through-frontend.jpg)

<Callout  type="warn" title="Warning">
As you can see from the picture, all the traffic has to be processed by a frontend (data are not stored on the frontend, but they load its CPUs and RAM), although the frontend is neither the source nor target of the data.
</Callout>

## Large data handling

In the case of large data, the frontend should be left out of the process, and data should be downloaded/uploaded directly on the [NFS4 storage server](../computing/infrastructure/storages). 

### Move data to/from a storage

Example:

```bash
local_user@home_PC:~$ scp MetaUser123@storage-brno2.metacentrum.cz:~/foo . # copy file "foo" from home directory at brno2 storage directly to a local PC
```

The overall scheme can be depicted as below:

![pic](/img/meta/data/cp-data-directly-storage.jpg)

<Callout  type="warn" title="Warning">
Do not use frontends to transfer large data. Processes consuming inadequate CPU and RAM frontend capacity will be stopped.
</Callout>

<Callout  type="info" title="Tip" icon="ðŸ’¡">
See **[table of storages](../computing/infrastructure/storages)** for storage server addresses and mount points.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
In general, the smaller number of files in the archive, the better (it speeds operations up and generates lower load on the storage subsystems; on the other hand, packing the files makes searching less comfortable). In case you need to archive a large number of small files, we recommend strongly to pack them before, as read/write operations are slower with many small files.
</Callout>

- if most of your files are large (hundreds of MBs, GBs, ...), don't bother with packing them and make a one-to-one copy to the archive,
- if your files are smaller and you don't plan to search individual files, pack them into `.tar` or `.zip` files,
- from the technical point of view, the optimal "chunk" of packed data is 500 MB or bigger,
- don't use front-end servers for anything else than moving several small files! Submit a regular job and/or take an interactive job instead to handle the archival data.
- keep in mind that the master HOME directory of each HSM storage is dedicated just for initialization scripts and thus has a limited quota of just 50 MB.


### Move data between storages

#### scp

If you want to move a large amount of data between storages, the setup is similar to the case when you copy data between your PC and storage. The only difference is that you cannot access storages interactively, and therefore, the scp command has to be passed as an argument to the `ssh` command.

For example, copy file foo from plzen1 to your home at brno2:

```bash
ssh MetaUser123@storage-plzen1.metacentrum.cz "scp ~/foo storage-brno6.metacentrum.cz:~/"
```

If you are already logged on a frontend, you can simplify (the system will automatically use the same username) the command to:

```bash
ssh storage-plzen1.metacentrum.cz "scp ~/foo storage-brno6.metacentrum.cz:~/"
```

The examples shown above will run only until you either disconnect or the validity of Kerberos ticket expires. For longer-lasting copy operations, it is a good idea to submit the `scp` command within a job. Prepare a trivial batch script called, e.g. `copy_files.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#PBS -N copy_files
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:scratch_local=2gb
#PBS -l walltime=15:00:00

ssh storage-plzen1.metacentrum.cz "scp ~/foo storage-brno6.metacentrum.cz:~/"
```

and submit it as `qsub copy_files.sh`.

#### rsync

Another option how to pass data between storages is to use `rsync` command.

For example, to move all your data from plzen1 to brno12-cerit:

```bash
(BUSTER)USERNAME@skirit:~$ ssh storage-plzen1 "rsync -avh ~ storage-brno12-cerit:~/home_from_plzen1/"
```

To move only a selected directory:

```bash
(BUSTER)USERNAME@skirit:~$ ssh storage-plzen1 "rsync -avh ~/my_dir storage-brno12-cerit:~/my_dir_from_plzen1/"
```

You can wrap the `rsync` command into a job, too.

```
#!/bin/sh
#PBS -N copy_files
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:scratch_local=1gb
#PBS -l walltime=15:00:00

ssh storage-plzen1 "rsync -avh ~ storage-brno12-cerit:~/home_from_plzen1/"
```

If you then look at the output of the running job, you can check how the data transfer proceeds.

```bash
USERNAME@NODE:~$ tail -f /var/spool/pbs/spool/JOB_ID.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz.OU
```
