title: Types od data storage
---
If you followed the documentation on computing, you obtained quite a good
idea how data is handled in MetaCentrum. This article contains a brief but
storage-centered summary of all types of storage in MetaCentrum and also
other storage facilities in the national e-infrastructure.

## Within MetaCentrum

### Scratch directories 

Computation jobs typically process data that is kept in **scratch directories**. Those usually reside directly on computation nodes and **serve purely for keeping the data during the computation**. The job should clean scratch directories after itself. Read [more about scratch directories](../computing/infrastructure/scratch-storages).

### Home directories

**Home directories** are disk arrays mounted as file systems to computational clusters and frontends. They are conveniently named after cities, as it is generally the fastest to access data kept in the vicinity of the computation. Home directories **serve for storing user's data between computation jobs**, i.e.  for weeks to months, possibly even years. Their capacity is nevertheless limited to storage volumes that can be reasonably handled on a shared file system.  You can learn [all about home directories here](../computing/infrastructure/storages).

{/*
note especially the relationship between clusters and storages (FIXME link) and be advised that not all of them are backed up (FIXME link). You can even (FIXME link) mount them to your own computer.

## Outside of MetaCentrum

### Object storage

Should your data exceed capacities available as home directories, you can consider using services of generic data storage facilities available in the infrastructure and operated by the [Data Storage Department](https://docs.du.cesnet.cz/en/infrastructure/description). That is a system of large capacity **object storage facilities** typically accessed through S3 protocol. Object storages **can be used both for high capacities as well as longer-term data storage**. Requirements exceeding 10 TB (or even hundreds TB) and years of storage time are generally possible, they should nevertheless be discussed individually.

### National repository platform (NRP)

For **long-term data storage**, the **[National repository platform](https://www.eosc.cz/en/projects/national-repository-platform-for-research-data-os-i-nrp/national-repository-platform)** is being built, providing repositories. NRPs are storage systems for data equipped with rich metadata that help making the data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR data).
