title: How to search for software
---
There are thousands of packages installed at MetaCentrum. The list of selected software is by far not complete.

In general, when searching for an application, you should checklist the following:

1. Look at the list of selected software either [sorted alphabetically](../software/alphabet) or [by field of interest]().
2. Use `module avail` command as described [on this page](#modules).
3. Go through software prepared as [containers](#containers).

    No luck? The consult [how to install new (version of) software](../software/install-software) either locally or system-wide.
</Callout>

## Modules

To search for any package, use command `module avail PACKAGE_NAME`.

<Callout type="info" title= "Search is case-insensitive">
    For example, `module avail r/` and `module avail R/` are the same for the purpose of searching. Other commands, however (such as `module add` or `module load`) are case-sensitive.
</Callout>


<Callout type="info" title="You can use stars (with backslash or quotes)">
    The `module avail` command accepts bash special characters. The most useful is the `*` which replaces any string; for example `module avail g\*`, `module avail 'g*'`, `module avail "g*"` lists all modules beginning with "g".
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Why backslash or quotes?">
    To make it to `module avail`, the `*` must be protected by backslash or quotes not to be expanded by shell. To experiment with this behaviour, try `touch g001; module avail g*` (returns nothing) versus `touch g001; module avail g\*` (returns list of modules).
</Callout>

### Example 1: Orca versions

```bash
(BULLSEYE)user123@skirit:~$ module avail or
----------- /packages/run/modules-5/debian11avx512 ---------------
orca/  orthofinder/  

Key:
modulepath  directory/ 
```
The above search will return all modules starting with the string "or".

```bash
(BULLSEYE)user123@skirit:~$ module avail orca
----------- /packages/run/modules-5/debian11avx512 ---------------
orca/  

Key:
modulepath  directory/  
```
The above search is limited only to "orca" package, but does not show versions.

```bash
(BULLSEYE)user123@skirit:~$ module avail orca/
----------- /packages/run/modules-5/debian11avx512 ---------------
orca/2.6.4  orca/3.0.1  orca/4.0.2  orca/4.1.1  orca/4.1.2  orca/4.2.0  orca/4.2.1  orca/5.0.1-intel-19.0.4-bnofsgq  orca/5.0.3-intel-19.0.4-dyfxe2x  

Key:
modulepath  
```
With "/" at the end, the search will output all versions available for the specified module.

### Example 2: R package

Modulefiles of system-wide installed R package are of the form `r-PACKAGE`.

To list all R packages, run
```bash
module avail r-*
```

Let's say you want to use package `bsgenome`. Commands
```bash
module avail bsgenome
module avail bsgenome*
```

will yield nothing.

On the other hand,
```bash
module avail *bsgenome*
```

will show up the package.

## Containers

A part of software is prepared as Singularity containers.

You can list them from any frontend at `/cvmfs/singularity.metacentrum.cz/` directory - for respective subdirectories, see [description on this page](../software/containers#pre-built-singularity-images).

For instructions on container usage, see [the containers chapter](../software/containers).

## Services

There are a number of [services closely connected to MetaCentrum](../related/galaxy) which may offer the software you need, too.
