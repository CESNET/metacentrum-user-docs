MetaCentrum offers various utilities on frontends.

Usage of these utilities is not necessary to get full-featured MetaCentrum services, however, it may make the work on the CLI easier.

## Go to scratch

- Command go_to_scratch changes the directory from a frontend to the scratch of a specified job
- usage: `go_to_scratch [job_ID]`
- see more on [how to get job ID](../computing/run-basic-job#job-id)


## Check local quota

- If you encounter the message "exhausted root filesystem quota" on a specific node, use the check-local-quota command to diagnose the issue. This error typically occurs when your jobs generate large output (`.OU`), error (`.ER`), or temporary files in directories like `/var/spool` or `/tmp`.
- usage: Access the node via SSH
  ```bash
  $ ssh novak@turin28.metacentrum.cz
  ```
  Run the following command to view files consuming your tmp filesystem quota:
  ```bash
  $ check-local-quota
  ```
  Inspect and manage files: If the listed files contain valuable data, copy them to `/storage`. Once copied, remove the unnecessary files or directories to free up space:
  ```bash
  $ rm file_XX
  $ rm -rf directory_XX
  ```
