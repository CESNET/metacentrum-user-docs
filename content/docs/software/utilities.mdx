title: Utilities
---

MetaCentrum offers various utilities on frontends and compute nodes.

Usage of these utilities is not necessary to get full-featured MetaCentrum services. However, it may make the work on the CLI and with the infrastructure easier.

## Go to scratch

- Command `go_to_scratch` automatically changes (redirects) the directory from a frontend server to the scratch of the used compute node
- Usage is `go_to_scratch [job_ID]`

```bash
  user_name@frontend:~$ go_to_scratch 12345
  user_name@compute_node:/scratch/user_name/job_12345.pbs-m1$
  ```

- See more on [how to get job ID](../computing/run-basic-job#job-id)
- `go_to_scratch` command works only 24 hours after the calculation is done or terminated. After this period, the user needs to use an `ssh` to log in to the compute node and the `cd` command for navigation to the scratch directory.  

  ```bash
  user_name@frontend:~$ ssh compute_node
  user_name@compute_node:~$ cd /scratch/user_name/job_ID.pbs-m1
  ```


## Check local quota

- If you encounter the message "exhausted root filesystem quota" on a specific node, use the check-local-quota command to diagnose the issue. This error typically occurs when your jobs generate large output (`.OU`), error (`.ER`), or temporary files in directories like `/var/spool` or `/tmp`.
- Usage: Access the node via SSH
  ```bash
  $ ssh novak@turin28.metacentrum.cz
  ```
  Run the following command to view files consuming your tmp filesystem quota:
  ```bash
  $ check-local-quota
  ```
  Inspect and manage files: If the listed files contain valuable data, copy them to `/storage`. Once copied, remove the unnecessary files or directories to free up space:
  ```bash
  $ rm file_XX
  $ rm -rf directory_XX
  ```
