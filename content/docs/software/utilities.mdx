MetaCentrum offers various utilities on frontends.

Usage of these utilities is not neccessary to get full-featured MetaCentrum services, however it may make the work on CLI easier.

## Go to scratch

- change directory from a frontend to the scratch of a specified job
- usage: `go_to_scratch [job_ID]`
- see more on [how to get job ID](../computing/run-basic-job#job-id)
