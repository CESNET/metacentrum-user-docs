title: Large local databases
---
Metacentrum maintains local copies of several large public databases covering various fields, primarily life sciences. Having these databases in one central location saves computing time and disk storage capacity that would otherwise be required for users to repeatedly download the same database.

<Callout type="info" title="Adding another large database?">
If you cannot find a database that meets your needs, please [contact us](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/support), and we will download it for you.

<Callout type="info" title="Outdated database?">
[Let us know](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/support) as soon as you find that any database is outdated. We will upgrade it.

Large databases are currently located in the folder `/storage/projects-du-praha/Bio_databases`. Please note that not all databases are located there. Some installed software tools have their own databases within their installation path, which are usually smaller.
