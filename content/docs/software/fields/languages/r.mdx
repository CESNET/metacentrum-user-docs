```

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. 

## Usage

**Search for a particular R package among r- modules**

Libraries (packages) for R are istalled in a separate module each with a modulefile name in the form `r-PACKAGE`.

To list versions of a particular package, run

```bash
module avail r-PACKAGE/
```

To get list of all installed R packages, run a command

```bash
module avail r-*
```

**List packages installed within basic R module**

Some of the basic libraries are installed together with module for R.

To list all R version, run

```bash
module avail r/
```

After loading a particular version of R, you can list all packages by function `installed.packages()`.

For example:

```bash
$ module add r/4.2.1-intel-19.0.4-d3gtjq7
$ R
> installed.packages()
```
