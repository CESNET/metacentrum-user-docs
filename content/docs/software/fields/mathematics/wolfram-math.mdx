[Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is a CAS (Computer Algebra System) like Matlab and Maple. It is able to analyse data sets, solve complex differential equations, and develop an entire solution for fast, high-precision numeric and symbolic computation. Mathematica also provides 2D and 3D data visualisation and programming capabilities.

## Licences

<Callout  type="warn" title="Warning">
**MetaCentrum no longer provides MetaCentrum-wide licences for Mathematica**. The only possibility is that users bring their own (institution's) license. If you are interested in using your Mathematica license within the MetaCentrum infrastructure, contact us for more details at meta@cesnet.cz.

<Callout  type="info" title="Tip" icon="ðŸ’¡">
To enable computationally intensive computations within Mathematica, one can make use of its parallel/distributed extension called GridMathematica -- see details at [GridMathematica](content/docs/software/sw-list/gridmathematica.mdx) documentation.
