[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

## RStudio in OnDemand

RStudio can be run in a browser as [OnDemand service](https://ondemand.metacentrum.cz). This is the most straighforward and simplest way.

Since the OnDemand can run on any machine, there is an option to choose custom `home` directory. This can be useful for example to have consisten version of `.Rhistory` dir, where a history of R commands is kept.

## RStudio as a Jupyter Notebook in Kubernetes

Another option is to use [Kubernetes service](https://docs.cerit.io/).

JupyterHub offers a straightforward way to launch [RStudio](https://docs.cerit.io/en/rancher-apps/rstudio) directly from your Jupyter Notebook environment.

* Integration with MetaCentrum home, making it convenient for users already working within this ecosystem.
* AI chat support in version marked as *AI
* Many RStudio versions are supported through this option.
