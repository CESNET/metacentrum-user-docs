[Allinea DDT](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101136/22-1-3/) is a debugging tool from Allinea Inc., designed for debugging parallel/distributed programs using OpenMP/MPI libraries. Its primary aim is to provide a powerful and user-friendly graphical user interface, together with unique features such as so-called Parallel Stack Viewer (providing a global overview of the status of all the debugged application's threads/processes).

## Usage

- the debugger is licensed for 32 simultaneously debugged processes
-  DDT may be used just on the clusters located at Botanick√° 68a, Brno
- The purchased licenses permit just an academic use of the program!
