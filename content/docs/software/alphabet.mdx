title: Alphabetically sorted software
---
<Callout type="info" title="The list is not complete.">
**Only software where there are some caveats and/or howtos for users is included.** The ultimate tool for searching is the `module avail` command. See [How to search for software](../software/search-soft) page.
</Callout>


<Callout type="info" title="New software or its version.">
Due to the number of available application tools and their versions, we cannot maintain (upgrade) them all periodically. Exceptions are licensed software, compilators, drivers and so on. Softwares are installed/upgraded mainly on personal request at meta@cesnet.cz. We mostly prefer [users' self-installations](./install-software), and we are ready to help with them.
