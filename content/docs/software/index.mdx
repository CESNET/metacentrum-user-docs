*Welcome to an overview page concerning software in MetaCentrum.*

<Callout type="info" title="New software or its version.">
Due to the number of available application tools and their versions, we cannot maintain (upgrade) them all periodically. Exceptions are licensed software, compilators, drivers and so on. Softwares are installed/upgraded mainly on personal request at meta@cesnet.cz. We mostly prefer [users' self-installations](./install-software), and we are ready to help with them.
