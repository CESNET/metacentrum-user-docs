title: Genome Analysis Toolkit

```bash
module avail gatk/
```

[Genome Analysis Toolkit](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) is a generic tool for pairwise sequence comparison. It allows you to align sequences using many alignment models, either exhaustive dynamic programming or a variety of heuristics.  

## Usage

In the `qsub` command, it is necessary to specify the parameter `ompthreads` to allow a run on multiple threads, e.g. (for eight threads):

```bash
qsub -l select=1:ncpus=8:ompthreads=8:mem=...
```

### Versions 4.X

GATK 4 has a wrapper script, `gatk`, which significantly simplifies commands.

```bash
gatk --help    # to print help
gatk --list    # to list all available tools inside the toolkit
```

An example of a command with data:

```bash
gatk --java-options "-Xmx20G" HaplotypeCaller -R reference.fasta -I input.bam -O output.vcf
```

The `-Xmx` memory option represents the amount of memory used only by the java process. However, the user must request more memory from PBS to cover all other processes outside of java. For example, for `-Xmx20g`, reserve `mem=30gb` from PBS.

### Versions 3.X and 2.X

Initialization also makes java/opendjk and system variable `$GATK` available pointing into the GATK install directory. Usage of one of the tools with sample data (not for version 3.8-0):

```bash
java -Xmx20g -jar "$GATK"/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T CountReads -R "$GATK"/resources/exampleFASTA.fasta -I "$GATK"/resources/exampleBAM.bam
```

During large data processing, some problems with the size of the `tmp` directory can occur (and can lead to the end of a job or a significant slowdown). In this case, add the parameter `-Djava.io.tmpdir="${SCRATCHDIR}"/tmp` into the java command.

List of tools and version check:

```
java -jar "$GATK"/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar --help
java -jar "$GATK"/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar --version
```
