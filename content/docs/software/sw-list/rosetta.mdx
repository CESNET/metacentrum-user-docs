```bash
module avail rosetta/
```

[Rosetta suite](https://docs.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/Home) includes algorithms for computational modeling and analysis of protein structures. It has enabled notable scientific advances in computational biology, including de novo protein design, enzyme design, ligand docking, and structure prediction of biological macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.

These libraries provide optimized functions and algorithms that leverage the parallel processing power of GPUs for various computational tasks. 

## License

To use Rosetta, you will also need to [accept its license](https://signup.e-infra.cz/fed/registrar/?vo=meta&group=lic_rosetta). 

## Tutorials

[Tutorials](https://docs.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/Home#tutorials) are also available for basic protocols. Files for these tutorials are available at `/software/rosetta/3.9/demos/tutorials`.

It is recommended to copy this folder to your own directory and carry out the protocols there.
