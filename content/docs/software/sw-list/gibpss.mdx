[GIbPSs](https://github.com/ahapke/gibpss) is a package for analysis of GBS (genotyping-by-sequencing) and RAD (restriction site associated DNA) sequence data. It handles paired-end or single reads from protocols such as GBS, two-enzyme GBS, and ddRAD. It can also analyze forward reads from RAD libraries. Its main purpose is genotyping of individuals from diploid organisms without a reference genome for population genetic and phylogeographic analyses.
