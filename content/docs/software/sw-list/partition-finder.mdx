[PartitionFinder](http://www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder/) is a free open source software to select best-fit partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution for phylogenetic analyses. Most of the lab's coding output currently goes into PartitionFinder. 

## Usage

You can run the application by typing `PartitionFinder.py` instead of python `PartitionFinder.py` which is used in the official documentation.

To see other parameters of PartitionFinder type `PartitionFinder.py --help`. In the same manner you can run `choooseK.py`. 

If you would like to run `distruct.py` you have to [use graphical environment](../../software/graphical-access).
