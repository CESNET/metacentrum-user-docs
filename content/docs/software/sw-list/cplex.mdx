[Cplex](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/cplex-optimizer) is a high-performance mathematical programming solver for linear programming, mixed integer programming, and quadratic programming. 

## Usage

**License**

You have to accept the [license](https://signup.e-infra.cz/fed/registrar/?vo=meta&group=lic_IBM-academic).

**Parallel run**

CPLEX utilizes OpenMP system (parallelization through many processor cores in one machine). You can restrict the number of cores by set up of system variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, for example:

```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$PBS_NUM_PPN 
```

which uses the number of processors granted by planning system. You can also restrict the number of cores directly in the program by set up a proper directive in .mod file:

```
execute{
  cplex.threads = XXX;
}
```
