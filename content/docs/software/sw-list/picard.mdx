[Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) is a set of Java command line tools for manipulating high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data and formats such as SAM/BAM/CRAM and VCF. 

## Usage

<Callout  type="warn" title="Warning">
Be aware that Picard needs a defined `$SCRATCHDIR` variable for successful running.
</Callout>

<Callout  type="warn" title="Warning">
To run Picard version `<= 2.22.1`  you need Java as well - load manually `module add jdk/`.
</Callout>

Users can list available tools:

```bash
java -jar $PICARD
```

And run individual tools, for example:

```bash
java -jar $PICARD CreateSequenceDictionary -h #will print manual page
java -jar $PICARD CreateSequenceDictionary R=reference.fasta O=reference.dict
```

Since version 2.27.5, the usage is more straightforward.

```bash
module add picard # it will load the newest version of Picard
picard <program name> -h
```

Java processes within Picard may exceed the quota for saving temporary files in the root directory (`/tmp`). When calculation fails with something like `Caused by: java.io.IOException: Disk quota exceeded`, call the command

```bash
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Djava.io.tmpdir=$SCRATCHDIR"
```

before starting Picard. This command redirects temporary files to the scratch.
