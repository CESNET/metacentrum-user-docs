[Abinit](https://www.abinit.org/doc) is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy, charge density and electronic structure of molecular systems within Density Functional Theory (DFT).

## Usage

To use abinit-gui you need to copy a file `/software/abinit-7.10.2/gui/ABINIT_variables.json` to current directory. This is to avoid an error message "File 'ABINIT\_variables.json' does not exist. Help and pre-processing might not be available." 

**Parallel use**

Experiments of MetaCentrum users shows that the most effective way to use ABINIT parallel is by using MPI and not OpenMP:

```
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
    mpirun /software/abinit-7.10.2/intel/bin/abinit <input >output
```

**GUI**

There is available some basic GUI environment. However there can be used also GUIs from other MetaCentrum modules. The GUI overview is listed at [ABINIT FAQ](http://src.gnu-darwin.org/ports/science/abinit/work/abinit-5.2.4/doc/users/FAQ.html#GUI). Modules available in MetaCentrum are: XCrysDen and Molden. You can use the basic GUI by issuing a command:

```
    java -jar ${basedir}/../gui/AbinitGUI.jar
```
