title: AlphaFold
---
[AlphaFold](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold) is a cutting-edge software tool designed to predict 3D structures of proteins. Developed by DeepMind, AlphaFold has revolutionized the field of structural biology by providing accurate predictions of 3D models of protein structures, which is crucial for understanding their functions and interactions.

## Alphafold in Kubernetes

As as a first choice, we recommend to run Alphafold via [Kubernetes web application](https://docs.cerit.io/en/docs/web-apps/foldify) [Foldify](https://foldify.cloud.e-infra.cz).

Foldify provides a suite of tools, including:

 * AlphaFold3
 * AlphaFold2
 * ColabFold
 * OmegaFold
 * ESMFold

as well as integrated tool to compare between models (MultiFold).

## Alphafold in OnDemand

Another option is to run Alphafold on the grid infrastructure via [OnDemand service](../../graphical/ondemand). 

Follow these steps:

1. Access the [OnDemand dashboard](https://ondemand.metacentrum.cz) and navigate to the `Job Composer` -> `New job` -> `From template`.

2. From a list of templates, choose `Alphafold MetaCentrum job` -> `Create New Job`.

3. Finally, select the newly created job on the top of a list and click `Submit`..

## Alphafold as Singularity image in Remote desktop 

The .sif images of Alphafor reside in `/storage/brno11-elixir/projects/alphafold` directory together with databases and example scripts . This is where the OnDemand takes the images from.

Using [Remote desktop](../../../software/graphical-access), AlphaFold can be also run from a [Singularity](../../../software/containers) image manually. This option is recommended to advanced users or as a fallback option in case OnDemand and/or Kubernetes service are down.

**CUDA license**

To use Alphafold with CUDA, you will also need to accept license for cuDNN library. You will find the link on [MetaVO licence pages](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/cs/myaccount/licence.html).

**Models**

You can control which AlphaFold model to run by adding the `--model_preset= flag`. We provide the following models:

- `monomer`: This is the original model used at CASP14 with no ensembling.
- `monomer_casp14`: This is the original model used at CASP14 with `num_ensemble=8`, matching our CASP14 configuration. This is largely provided for reproducibility as it is 8x more computationally expensive for limited accuracy gain (+0.1 average GDT gain on CASP14 domains).
- `monomer_ptm`: This is the original CASP14 model fine tuned with the pTM head, providing a pairwise confidence measure. It is slightly less accurate than the normal monomer model.
- `multimer`: This is the AlphaFold-Multimer model. To use this model, provide a multi-sequence FASTA file. In addition, the UniProt database should have been downloaded.

**Speed/Quality**

You can control MSA speed/quality tradeoff by adding `--db_preset=reduced_dbs` or `--db_preset=full_dbs` to the run command. We provide the following presets:

- `reduced_dbs`: This preset is optimized for speed and lower hardware requirements. It runs with a reduced version of the BFD database. It requires 8 CPU cores (vCPUs), 8 GB of RAM, and 600 GB of disk space.
- `full_dbs`: This runs with all genetic databases used at CASP14.

**Tips and useful information**

Example of run with different models and speed/quality tradeoff with example file `seq.fasta`, multimer with `multi.fasta`. This test shows difference of RAM consuming a length of run with the same test.
