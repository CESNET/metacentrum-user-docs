[Kraken 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml) is the newest version of Kraken, a taxonomic classification system using exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast classification speeds. This classifier matches each k-mer within a query sequence to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes containing the given k-mer. The k-mer assignments inform the classification algorithm. 

## Database

There is an `nt` Kraken2 database available in a shared location. In order to use it, run

```bash
kraken2 --db /storage/brno12-cerit/projects/Bio_databases/kraken2_nt_20240530
# includes the NCBI Taxonomy database
```

```bash
# older releases:  
# /storage/brno12-cerit/projects/Bio_databases/kraken2_nt_20230502
```

and request at least `mem=890gb` for `kraken2_nt_20240530` database (unless only a short query is processed with the `--memory-mapping` option) or `mem=520gb` for `kraken2_nt_20230502` database (unless only a short query is processed with the `--memory-mapping` option). 

For optimal performance of access to this database, we recommend adding `qsub` requirement `cluster=halmir`. This selects machines with the fastest network connection to the database storage.
