[Kraken 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml) is the newest version of Kraken, a taxonomic classification system using exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast classification speeds. This classifier matches each k-mer within a query sequence to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes containing the given k-mer. The k-mer assignments inform the classification algorithm. 

## Database

There are public Kraken2 databases (originally from https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/) available in a shared location. In order to use one of them, run

```bash
kraken2 --db /storage/projects-du-praha/Bio_databases/kraken2/CHOSEN_DATABASE
# includes the NCBI Taxonomy database
```

and request enough memory to contain the entire database (e.g. at least `mem=900gb` for `kraken2_nt_20240530` database, please use `du -h` on database directory to get its size), unless only a short query is processed with the `--memory-mapping` option.

For fast access to the largest databases (e.g. kraken2_nt_20240530, k2_gtdb_genome_reps_20250609, k2_core_nt_20250609), we recommend adding `qsub` requirement `cluster=turin`. This selects machines with the fastest network connection to the database storage.
