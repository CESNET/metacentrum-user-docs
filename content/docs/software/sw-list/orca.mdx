[Orca](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal) is a general purpose tool for quantum chemistry with specific emphasis on spectroscopic properties of open-shell molecules. 

Orca features a wide variety of standard quantum chemical methods ranging from semiempirical methods to DFT to single- and multireference correlated ab initio methods. It can also treat environmental and relativistic effects. 

## Usage

### License

To use the application, you first need to accept its licence:

- [Orca version 3.0.1](https://signup.e-infra.cz/fed/registrar/?vo=meta&group=lic_orca)
- [Orca version 4.x.x and above](https://signup.e-infra.cz/fed/registrar/?vo=meta&group=lic_orca40)

### Notes

**Docs**

User reference manuals (as pdf files) are placed in `/cvmfs/software.metacentrum.cz/spack1/software/orca/`.

**Path specification**

You should always run the Orca program with its full path because it finds the program parts according to the run path. 

Example:

```bash
$(which orca) input
```

or directly

```bash
/software/orca-3.0.1/bin/orca in.inp
/software/orca/4.2.1/orca in.inp
```

Some of the newer versions of Orca (typically > `5.0`) are prepared using the Spack package manager, and the directory structure is different

```bash
# example for module orca/5.0.1-intel-19.0.4-bnofsgq
/cvmfs/software.metacentrum.cz/spack1/software/orca/linux-debian10-x86_64/5.0.1-intel-bnofsg/bin/orca in.inp
```

**OpenMPI computing**

Don't try to run `mpirun -np $NCPUs orca`. ORCA will take care of it if you have the [!PAL keyword](https://www.orcasoftware.de/tutorials_orca/first_steps/parallel.html) set.

**Usage with NAMD**

[NAMD](../../software/sw-list/namd.md) uses the Orca application for some computation. However, due to different installation methods, both programs usually use different OpenMPI to run. 

In the Orca-4.2.1 module is created a wrapper for `orca` binary to avoid OpenMPI mismatch problems. Now, it should be sufficient to put the path to this orca wrapper to the NAMD configuration file and avoid running `module add orca/4.2.1` in your PBS script. For documentation purposes, the wrapper is this:

```
#!/bin/bash
eval $(env |sed -n '/^OMPI/s/^\([^=]*\).*/unset \1;/p')
module add orca/4.2.0
exec /software/orca/4.2.1/orca "$@"
```
