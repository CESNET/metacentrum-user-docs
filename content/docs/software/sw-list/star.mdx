[STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) is a software for detection and characterization of sliced RNAs. 

## Usage

Example of module initialization and run:

```bash
$ module add star/2.7.7a
$ STAR --option1 value1 --option2 value2
```

The application supports parallel computing. For this reason the important option is `--runThreadN.` This option the defines the number of threads to be used for genome generation. By default it is 1.

It is appropriate to set the number of threads to value of the variable `PBS_NUM_PPN`:

```bash
STAR --runThread $PBS_NUM_PPN ...
```
