[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) is an open-source package management and environment management system that is commonly used in the Python programming ecosystem. 

Mamba is a re-implementation of [Conda](../../software/sw-list/conda-modules) written in C++, offering some benefits.
- Parallel downloading of repository data and package files using multi-threading.
- Libsolv for much faster dependency solving.
- C++ implementation for maximum efficiency.

The syntax of `mamba` commands is basically the same as that of [Conda](../../software/sw-list/conda-modules). Mamba utilises the same command line parser, package installation code and transaction verification routines as conda to stay as compatible as possible.

```bash
conda env list			vs.	mamba env list
conda create --prefix...	vs. 	mamba create --prefix...
conda activate /storage/...	vs.	mamba activate /storage/...
conda deactivate		vs.	mamba deactivate
```

<Callout  type="info" title="Tip" icon="ðŸ’¡">
```bash
We would like to encourage users to use Mamba as a primary tool to invoke and install environments. Module `mambaforge` can even access environments installed in `conda-modules`, and thus can act as a full replacement of `conda-modules` module.
```

<Callout  type="warn" title="Warning">
```bash
Avoid combining Mamba environments with traditional modules in a single session. Doing so can often lead to conflicts and application malfunctions.
```

## Usage

### Use existing environment

The basic commands are:

```bash
module add mambaforge     # load the module
mamba env list            # list installed environments
mamba activate busco      # activate an environment (e.g. busco)
mamba --help              # use selected application
mamba deactivate          # quit
```

### Install new environment

See [How to install Conda/Mamba packages](../../software/install-software#condamamba-packages).
