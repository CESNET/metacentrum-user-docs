[Quantum espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) is an integrated suite of spensource computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.

## Usage

**Parallel version**

In the case of using mpi version, add explicitly mpi modul after adding of espresso, e.g. for `espresso/5.0-mpi`

```bash
module add espresso/5.0-mpi
```

and run (MPI version)

```bash
mpiexec pw.x
```

**Example run**

For testing examples e.g. in `/software/espresso-5.0/single/PW/example` it is necessary to change path in file `run_example` for `environmental_variables` e.g. to `/software/espresso-5.0/single/environmental_variables`.

**Van der Waals kernel table**

If your run assumes `vdW_kernel_table`, you can generate it by

```bash
generate_vdW_kernel_table.x 
```

than you should copy it into `$PSEUDO_DIR` (folder that is set after adding of module).
