```bash
module avail migrate/
```

[Migrate](https://peterbeerli.com/migrate-html5/index.html) estimates effective population sizes and past migration rates between N populations assuming a migration matrix model with asymmetric migration rates and different subpopulation sizes.

## Usage

You can run Migrate as a single core, thread or MPI version of migrate by commands

```
migrate-n-single
migrate-n
mpirun migrate-n-mpi
```

`mpirun` needs to set the complete path to the programme (`$PATH` is not enough):

```
mpirun $(which migrate-n-mpi) -nomenu
or
mpirun /software/migrate-4.4.3/migrate-4.4.3/src/bin/migrate-n-mpi -nomenu
```
