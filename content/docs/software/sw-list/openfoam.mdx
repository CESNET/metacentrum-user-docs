## Usage

### Apptainer image

To read more about using Apptainer images, see [Containers usage in MetaCentrum](../../software/containers).

### Notes

- `openfoam/8.0` version: it is necessary to source two files; `source /software/openfoam/8.0/OpenFOAM-8/etc/bashrc`; `source /software/openfoam/8.0/OpenFOAM-dev/etc/bashrc`
- If you want to use the job monitoring, you must set the variable `FOAM_JOB_DIR` so that it points to your directory, which must contain two subdirectories named `runningJobs` and `finishedJobs`. OpenFOAM uses these directories to store the data about jobs. You can get this information about your job via `foamCheckJobs` or `foamPrintJobs` command.
