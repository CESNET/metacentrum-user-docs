```bash
module avail debianX/ # where X = {7,8,9,10,11}
```

## Usage

Modules `debianX/compat` are backwards-compatibility packages which bring some missing libraries across OS Debian versions. If you experience any problem with libraries or applications compatibility in the current Debian version, try to add an any-version-older module.

An explicit list of libraries for every respective Debian version can be found in the directory `/software/debian-compat/debianX/lib/`.

### Example

1. Suppose you run into a problem with a missing library and typically get the `error while loading shared libraries: XYZ.so.0: cannot open` error or similar.

2. Check whether the missing library is available in some `debianX/compat` module. If yes, load the appropriate module.

```bash
   module add debian10/compat
```

3. Run the job again.
