[Velvet](https://github.com/dzerbino/velvet) is a frequently used assembler in many sequencing projects that are focused on de novo assembly from NGS technology data. Velvet is capable of handling paired and also single reads. It permits the user to set many of assembly conditions. 

## Usage

### Known problems

If program Velvetg ends with "core dumped", try to change the `k-mer` parameter to other value.

(It is known that problematic values can be 11 and 13.) 

If you need work with short k-mers, utry using velvet version 1.2.09 which is compiled with parameter `BIGASSEMBLY=1`.
