title: GPU job
---
To run GPU calculation, the user needs to specify **number of GPU cards** only. The PBS scheduler will route the job automatically into one of the **[gpu queues](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/queues/list)**.

<Callout type="info" title="User group `iti` has a reserved GPU queue">
    Members of the [`iti` group](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/group/pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz/iti) (Institute of Theoretical Informatics, University of West Bohemia) have their own GPU cluster `konos` with priority access through direct submit to `iti@pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz` queue.
</Callout>

## PBS resources

### ngpus

Parameter `ngpus` specifies how many GPU cards the job will use. Default value: `0`.
```bash
qsub -l select=1:ncpus=1:ngpus=2 ... 
```
### gpu mem

PBS parameter `gpu_mem` specifies minimum amount of memory that the GPU card will have. 
```bash
qsub -l select=1:ncpus=1:ngpus=1:gpu_mem=10gb -l walltime=1:00:00
```
### gpu\_cap

PBS parameter `gpu_cap` is [Cuda compute capability as defined on this page](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities).


### Architecture

The user can specify a *minimal required architecture* (`compute_XY`), or a *minimal required version within a given architecture* (`sm_XY`).

Minimal architecture:
```bash
gpu_cap=compute_70   # will give you 7.0, 7.1, ... 7.5, but also 8.0, 9.0 ...
```
Minimal version of a chosen architecture, e.g. 7 ("Volta"):
```bash
gpu_cap=sm_72        # will give you 7.2 till 7.5, but not 8.0 and higher
```
The requirements can be combined in a comma-separated string.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
    The commas are evaluated as an OR operand.
</Callout>

Example:
```bash
qsub -l select=1:ngpus=1:gpu_cap=\"sm_65,compute_70\":mem=4gb -l walltime=1:00:00  # 6.5 or 7.0 and higher
qsub -l 'select=1:ngpus=1:gpu_cap="sm_65,compute_70":mem=4gb' -l walltime=1:00:00  # dtto
```
<Callout type="info" title="Note">
 Note that the quotes enclosing the `gpu_cap` options must be protected against shell expansion either by escaping them or by enclosing the whole `qsub` command into single quotes.
</Callout>

### cuda\_version

PBS parameter `cuda_version` is version of CUDA installed.

## GPU usage data

To be able to monitor GPU usage effectivity, we offer 3 parameters. To find out about them from CLI, use PBS command `qstat -fw`.

```bash
(BOOKWORM)user_123@skirit:~$ qstat -fw job_ID | grep gpu
    resources_used.gpupercent = 332
    resources_used.gpupowerusage = 38.7777
    resources_used.gpumemmaxpercent = 149
```

### gpupercent 

- how much the GPU(s) have been used during the job
- measured in %

<Callout type="alert" title="For more GPUs, the percentages sum up.">
For jobs with more than 1 GPU, the values for respective card are summed up. I.e. the value can be > 100 %, but not > 100 * `ngpus` %.
</Callout>

### gpupowerusage

- how much energy was burned on all GPUs for a given job
- measured in Wh

### gpumemmaxpercent

- the maximum peak of GPU memory usage
- measured in %

<Callout type="alert" title="For more GPUs, the percentages sum up.">
For jobs with more than 1 GPU, the values for respective card are summed up. I.e. the value can be > 100 %, but not > 100 * `ngpus` %.
</Callout>

## System variables

IDs of GPU cards are stored in `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable.

These IDs are mapped to CUDA tools virtual IDs. Though if `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` contains value 2, 3 then CUDA tools will report IDs 0, 1.
