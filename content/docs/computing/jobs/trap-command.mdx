title: Trap command usage
---
To manage proper cleaning of scratch space, users can take advantage of `trap` command and `clean_scratch` script.

`trap` command allows users to catch signals from OS and execute a code when they occur.


`clean_scratch` is a systemwide-installed MetaCentrum utility that removes the content of the current job's scratch directory.

    While it is perfectly OK to use the `trap` command instruction upon the normal ending of a job, in case the job is killed (either by PBS or user) the results may be not always what the user expected, depending on the amount of data in scratch. 
</Callout>

## Trap the EXIT

**`trap 'clean_scratch' EXIT`**

`EXIT` is not a signal, but for the purpose of `trap` command it can be treated in the same way.

`EXIT` happens when the script ends, either by executing the last line or via the `exit` command somewhere in the bash script:

```
#!/bin/bash
cp fileXXX "$SCRATCHDIR/" || { echo >&2 "cp of fileXXX failed!"; exit 1; }
```
If the copying of `fileXXX` failed, the job will end AND the scratch space will be cleaned.

## Trap the TERM

**`trap 'clean_scratch' TERM`**

`TERM` is a OS signal a job receives when it is terminated from "outside", i.e. when it does not finish in normal way.

The job may be killed either by PBS or by the user (`qdel` command):

The batch script receives `SIGTERM` signal. **There is no way how to distinguish whether the job was killed by PBS or by the user.** Upon receiving the `SIGTERM`, the running process may take a variety of actions - it may stop immediately, or it may attempt to clean up *and* stop, or it may do nothing. If the process keeps running, the `SIGTERM` signal is after some delay followed by `SIGKILL` (equivalent to `kill -9`), which stops it immediately.

- What action is taken upon receiving a `SIGTERM` can be defined via `trap` command. 
- `SIGKILL` cannot be trapped, ignored nor reacted to.

This construction is useful to clean up after failed jobs **where the user is not interested in any data produced by the job** and in such cases we encourage users to apply it (see [section below](#caveats) for potential pitfalls.)

## Trap both EXIT and TERM 

**`trap 'clean_scratch' EXIT TERM`**

This construction combines both purposes mentioned above.

## Caveats

<Callout  type="info" title="Tip" icon="ðŸ’¡">
    Currently the delay between `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL` is **10 seconds**.<br/>Depending on the amount of data in scratch, some code constructions within the `trap` command may run to and end, while other may not. This can lead to unexpected behaviour.
</Callout>

**Example 1**

*Idea:* if the job crashes, copy away potentially valuable files, then clean the scratch.

```
trap 'cp all_checkpoint_files somewhere_safe/ ; clean_scratch' TERM  
```

*Potential hazard:* if the checkpoint files are large and/or numerous, the copy operation may not finish in time before being interrupted by `SIGKILL` signal. Some of the files may be missing and/or incomplete. Moreover the scratch directory will not be cleaned.

*Solution:* If you already know that your job produces many and/or large files which you will need to retrieve in case the job crashes, it is safer to just let yourself know about it by adding a line to output:

```
trap 'echo "$PBS_JOBID job failed. Retrieve the files from $SCRATCHDIR on `hostname -f` node, then clean the scratch manually" /storage/..../' TERM  
```

**Example 2**

*Idea:* Using `trap` to clean scratches upon job exit poses no dangers.

*Potential hazard:* Suppose the user adds the trap with the purpose to clean up after the script has run to an end, then adds some small sanity check, e.g.:

```
#!/bin/bash
...
trap 'clean_scratch' EXIT
...
./potentially_long_calculation_producing_result_files
test -n some-directory || { echo >&2 "Directory does not exist!"; exit 1; }
cp result_files somewhere/
...
```

In this case, the scratch directory would be cleaned before the output files would be copied away.

*Solution:* When adding any sanity check, keep this risk in mind.
