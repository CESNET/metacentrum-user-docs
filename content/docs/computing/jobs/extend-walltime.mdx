title: Extend walltime
---
Users are allowed to prolong their jobs in a limited number of cases.

To do this, use the command `qextend job_ID additional_walltime`.

Time can be set as:

- a single number - interpreted as seconds
- `hh:mm:ss` - interpreted as hours:minutes:seconds

Example:
```bash
(BUSTER)user123@skirit:~$ qextend 8152779.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz 01:00:00
The walltime of the job 8152779.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz has been extended.
Additional walltime:	01:00:00
New walltime:		02:00:00
```

To prevent abuse of the tool, there is a quota limiting the `qextend` usage to:

- max. 20 times within the last 30 days, `AND`
- prolong the job(s) by up to 1440 CPU-hours within the last 30 days.

Job prolongations older than 30 days are "forgotten" and no longer occupy user's quota.

<Callout type="info" title="CPU-hours are not walltime hours">
    The user quota is set to hours-per-CPU. If you e.g. prolong a job running on 8 CPUs by 1 hour, 8 hours will be subtracted from your cputime fund.
</Callout>

To get the current state of your fund, run `qextend info`:

```bash
(BUSTER)user123@skirit:~$ qextend info

user123@META's info:

30-days counter limit:	20
Used counter limit:	2
Avail. counter limit:	18

30-days cputime fund:	1440:00:00
Used cputime fund:	01:00:01
Avail. cputime fund:	1438:59:59

Earliest rec. timeout:	2021-08-20 10:13:36.426429
```

The counter limit is how many times you can prolong a job.
Cputime fund is the amount of cpu-time you can use to prolong a job.
Earliest rec. timeout indicates when the oldest one of your prolongations made during last 30 days will be forgotten.

<Callout type="info" title="What to do if you run out of quota">
    If you reach the monthly limit and still need to prolong a job, it can be done upon request to user support at meta@cesnet.cz.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="How do I extend the array job?">
    The `qextend` command can be used to extend simple jobs only. If you need to extend the array job, let us know at meta@cesnet.cz user support.
</Callout>
