title: Finished jobs

## Last 24 hours

Use `qstat -x` command.

To include in `qstat` also finished (`F`) and moved (`M`) jobs, use `-x` option:
```bash
qstat -x -u user123 # list all jobs for user user123 including the finished ones
```
The finished jobs are displayed only if they are max. 24 hours old.

## Older

Use `pbs-get-job-history` custom command.

Users can get complex information about their current or historical (several months) batch jobs. For this there exists custom command `pbs-get-job-history`, which is available on all frontends and compute nodes and extracts the following information:

- complete batch job (submitted shell script)
- standard output and standard error files
- various technical logs

Basic usage is:
```bash
pbs-get-job-history job_ID
```
When the job history is found, individual files are stored in one folder named by its jobid.

Example of the output:
```bash
user123@elmo:~$ pbs-get-job-history 11808203.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz
    
11808203.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz  Job found
    
Storing job data in ./11808203.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz

```
