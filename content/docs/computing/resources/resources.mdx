title: PBS resources

## Chunk vs job

PBS concept is based on so-called **chunks** as basic computational units. A chunk is further indivisible set of resources placed on the same host . User may require one (default) or more chunks for a job.

Some resources can be defined per chunk, i.e. user can request them for each chunk separately. Examples of **chunk-wide resources** are number of CPUs, GPUs or scratch directory type and volume. 

Other resources can be defined only for the job as a whole. Examples of **job-wide resources** are walltime, type of queue or software licence. 

Chunks are typically used to optimize the resource usage of parallelized computations. There may be e.g. a driving process placed on one chunk with relatively few CPUs combined with parallelized parts of a job running on other chunk(s) with many CPUs. 

Chunks can be on one machine next to each other or always on different machines, depending on job-wide option `place`.

Number of chunks `N` is set with `-l select=[N]:`. When user needs to set up more chunks with different resources, they are concatenated with `+`. The `select` keyword can be used only once.

`N` is not mandatory in the `select` statement. Default value of `N` is 1.

Examples of chunk specification:
```bash
    -l select=:ncpus=2 # one chunk with two CPUs
    -l select=1:ncpus=2 # same as above
    -l select=1:ncpus=1+1:ncpus=2 # two chunks, one with one CPU and one with two CPUs
    -l select=6:ncpus=2:mem=4gb+3:ncpus=8:mem=4GB # six chunks with 2 CPUs and 4 GB of memory each and three chunks with 8 CPUs and 4 GB of memory each
```
Examples of `place` usage:
```bash
    -l select=2:ncpus=1 -l place=pack # two chunks, both must be on one host
    -l select=2:ncpus=1 -l place=scatter # two chunks which must be on different hosts
    -l select=2:ncpus=1 -l place=free # two chunks placed arbitrarily according to resource availability on (default)
```
If you are not sure about the number of needed processors, ask for an exclusive reservation of the whole machine:
```bash
    -l select=2:ncpus=1 -l place=exclhost # request whole host allocated to this job (without cpu and mem limit control)
    -l select=102:place=group=cluster # 102 cpus on one cluster
```
## Chunk-wide resources

### **CPUs**

Resource name: `ncpus`. Default value: `1`.

Example:
```bash
    -l select=1:ncpus=2 # request 2 CPUs
```
### **Memory** 

Resource name: `mem`. Default value: `400 MB`.

Example:
```bash
    -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=10gb # request 10 GB memory job
```

### **CPU type**

Resource name: `cpu_vendor`. 

In the Metacentrum grid there are both machines with AMD as well as Intel processors. Some software may be sensitive to the processor used (although most applications run seamlessly on both). Therefore you can request a specific CPU vendor:
```bash
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=1:cpu_vendor=amd  # use machine with AMD processor
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=1:cpu_vendor=intel # dtto with Intel
```
### **CPU speed**

Resource name: `spec`. 

CPUs across Metacentrum grid differ in their how fast they are. Therefore they are classed by parameter `spec` according to methodology of [SPEC CPU2017](https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/).  To see the `spec` values, go to [qsub assembler](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/qsub_pbspro) and see the drop-down menu in the `spec` parameter.

Example:
```bash
    qsub -l select=:spec=4.8 # 1 CPU with speed class 4.8 or higher
```
### **Scratch directory**

Resource names: `scratch_local`, `scratch_shared`, `scratch_ssd`, `scratch_shm`. 

Default value: none.

We offer four types of scratch storage:

- `scratch_local`
    - available on every node, located on regular hard disc
    - choose this type as a default if you have no reason to do otherwise
    - located in `/scratch/USERNAME/job_JOBID`
- `scratch_ssd`
    - located on small SSD disc
    - ultra fast (compared to local scratch), but smaller in volume
    - not available on all computational nodes!
    - to check for availability on a particular node: see [Node properties on Metavo pages](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/props)
    - recommended in jobs where the bottleneck is disc-related operations (applications that create/read a lot of files)
    - located in `/scratch.ssd/USERNAME/job_JOBID`
- `scratch_shared`
    - network volume which is shared between all clusters in a given location (city)
    - read/write operation slower than on local scratch
    - useful if you need to run more than one application that need access to the same data
    - not available on all computational nodes!
    - to check for availability on a particular node: see [Node properties on Metavo pages](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/props)
    - mounted to directory `/scratch.shared/USERNAME/job_JOBID`
- `scratch_shm`
    - scratch directory is in RAM
    - fastest, but data on scratch do not survive the end/failure of the job
    - use when you need ultra fast scratch AND when you absolutely don't care about data from failed/killed/ended jobs
    - boolean type, submitted as `scratch_shm=true`
    - maximum size of scratch is defined by mem (memory) parameter
    - remember to choose mem large enough (to hold both data in scratch and the actual memory requirements for the job)
    - mounted to directory `/dev/shm/scratch.shm/USERNAME/job_JOBID`

Scratch directory is not writable, only it's content is. Therefore you cannot clean the scratch by `rm -rf $SCRATCHDIR`, but you can do it by `rm -rf $SCRATCHDIR/*`. Users should always clear the content of scratch directory after the job ends to free disc space. Otherwise, this directory will be automatically deleted after approx. 14 days (earlier if there is lack of space on disks).

The most important system variables related to scratch are these:

- `SCRATCHDIR`: path to scratch directory
- `SCRATCH_TYPE`: type of scratch directory
- `SCRATCH_VOLUME`: size of scratch directory

Example:
```bash
    (BUSTER)user123@skirit:~$ qsub -I -l select=scratch_local=20gb -l walltime=1:00:00
    qsub: waiting for job 12910867.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz to start
    qsub: job 12910867.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz ready
    (BULLSEYE)user123@elmo3-3:~$ echo $SCRATCHDIR
    /scratch/user123/job_12910867.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz
    (BULLSEYE)user123@elmo3-3:~$ echo $SCRATCH_TYPE
    local
    (BULLSEYE)user123@elmo3-3:~$ echo $SCRATCH_VOLUME
    21474836480
```
### **Number of GPUs**

Resource name: `ngpus`. Default value: `0`.
```bash
    -l select=ncpus=1:ngpus=2 
```
### **OS**

Resource name: `os`, `osfamily`. 

To submit a job to a machine with specific operation system, use `os=OS_name`:
```bash
    zuphux$ qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:mem=1gb:scratch_local=1gb:os=debian11 …
```
To submit a job to a machine with a specific OS type, use `osfamily=OS_type_name`
```bash
    zuphux$ qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:mem=1gb:scratch_local=1gb:osfamily=debian …
```

### **Cluster**

Resource name: `cluster`, `cl_NAME`. Default value: none.

PBS allows you to choose a particular cluster (using either resource `cluster` or `cl_NAME`:
```bash
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:cluster=halmir # run the job on cluster "halmir"
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:cl_halmir=True # same as above
```
Alternatively, you can avoid a particular cluster:
```bash
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:cluster=^halmir 
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:cl_halmir=False
```
However it is not possible to combine conditions. If you e.g. want to avoid both `adan` and `halmir`, the following
```bash
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:cluster=^adan:cluster=^halmir
```
will not work. This is based on the principle that in PBS, every resource (in this case `cluster` resource) can be specified only once.

On the other hand, `cl_adan` and `cl_halmir` are different resources, so:
```bash
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:cl_adan=False:cl_halmir=False
```
will work and will avoid both `adan` and `halmir` clusters.

The same can be done with
```bash
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:cluster=^adan:cl_halmir=False
```

### **Location**

Resource names: `brno`, `budejovice`, `liberec`, `olomouc`, `plzen`, `praha`, `pruhonice`, `vestec`.

Default value: none.

As the physical machines are distributed over multiple locations in Czech republic, it may be useful to be ble to specify the location of the machine(s)
```bash
    qsub -l select=1:ncpus=1:brno=True # run on machines located in Brno.
```
### **MPI processes**

Resource name: `mpiprocs`, `ompthreads`. 

How many MPI processes would run on one chunk is specified by `mpiprocs=[number]`:
```bash
    -l select=3:ncpus=2:mpiprocs=2 # 6 MPI processes (nodefile contains 6 lines with names of vnodes), 2 MPI processes always share 1 vnode with 2 CPU
```
How many OpenMP threads would run in 1 chunk `ompthreads=[number]`, 2 omp threads on 1 chunks is default behaviour (`ompthreads = ncpus`).

## Job-wide resources

### **Duration**

Resource name: `walltime`. Default value: `24:00:00` (24 hours).

Maximal duration of a job is set in format `hh:mm:ss`.

Example:
```bash
    -l walltime=1:00:00 # one hour job
```
Users can to a certain extent prolong walltime in running jobs - see [`qextend` command](../../computing/jobs/extend-walltime)

### **Queue and/or PBS server**

Resource name: ``. Default value: ``.
If you need to send the job to a specific queue and/or specific PBS server, use the `qsub -q` option.
```bash
    qsub -q queue@server # specific queue on specific server
    qsub -q queue # specific queue on the current (default) server
    qsub -q @server # default queue on specific server
```
### **Licence**

Some software requires licence to run. Licence is set by parameter `-l`
```bash
    -l select=3:ncpus=1 -l walltime=1:00:00 -l matlab=1 # one licence for Matlab
```
## **Paths for output**

By default the job output (output, and error files) is saved in a folder from which the job was submitted (variable `PBS_O_WORKDIR`).

This behaviour for output, resp. error files can be changed by parameters -o, resp -e.
```
    -o /custom-path/myOutputFile
    -e /custom-path/myErrorFile
```
