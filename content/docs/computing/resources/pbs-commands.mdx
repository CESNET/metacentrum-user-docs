title: PBS commands
---
The most relevant native PBS commands (and related options) are:

- `qsub` - submit the job
- `qmove` - move the job to another queue 
- `qdel` - delete a waiting or running job
- `qstat` - view current state of jobs
- `pbsnodes` - get info about current node(s) state and their properties

## PBS commands check for Kerberos ticket

**Since Feb 2026, sll PBS commands prompt for a password in case the [Kerberos ticket](../../access/log-in#kerberos) is missing**

Normally the Kerberos ticket is issued upon login and lasts for 12 hours.

If the PBS command does not find a valid Kerberos ticket, it prompts the user for a password to renew it:

```bash
(BOOKWORM)user_123@skirit:~$ pbsnodes -v zenon12
Kerberos Authentication:
Attempt (1/3): user_123@META's Password: 
zenon12
     Mom = zenon12.cerit-sc.cz
     ntype = PBS
     state = job-busy
     ...
```

## qsub

Basic command to submit a job.

```bash
qsub -I -l select=1:ncpus=4:mem=4gb -l walltime=1:00:00 # interactive job
qsub  -l select=1:ncpus=4:mem=4gb:scratch_local=10gb -l walltime=1:00:00 myJob.sh # batch job
```

<Callout type="info" title="What if Kerberos ticket expires while the interactive job waits to run?">
In case the Kerberos ticket expires **after** the qsub command is issued, but **before** the interactive job starts to run, the user is again prompted for password after the job starts:
</Callout>

```bash
(BOOKWORM)user_123@skirit:~$ qsub -I -l select=vnode=zenon12
qsub: waiting for job 117665.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz to start
Kerberos Authentication:
Attempt (1/3): user_123@META's Password: 
qsub: job 117665.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz ready

(BOOKWORM)user_123@zenon12:~$ 
```

## qdel

The `qdel` command deletes a queing or running job.

Examples:

```bash
qdel job_ID # basic usage
qdel -W force job_ID # use if normal qdel does not work ("stuck" jobs)
```

## qmove

The `qmove` command moves a job to another queue.

Jobs can only be moved from one server to another if they are in the `Q` (queued), `H` (held), or `W` (waiting) states, and only if there are no running subjobs. A job in the Running (`R`), Transiting (`T`), or Exiting (`E`) state cannot be moved.

Example:
```bash
qmove uv@pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz 475337.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz # move job 475337.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz to a queue uv@pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz
```
## qstat

`qstat` command probes the state of jobs and queues mainly. See sections [Queues in Meta](../../computing/resources/queues)

For detailed options list, see `man qstat`.
