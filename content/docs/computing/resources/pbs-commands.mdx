title: PBS commands
---
The most relevant native PBS commands (and related options) are:

- `qsub` - submit the job
- `qmove` - move the job to another queue 
- `qdel` - delete a waiting or running job
- `qstat` - view current state of jobs
- `pbsnodes` - get info about current node(s) state and their properties

## qsub

Basic command to submit a job.

## qdel

The `qdel` command deletes a  queing or running job.

Examples:

```bash
qdel job_ID # basic usage
qdel -W force job_ID # use if normal qdel does not work ("stuck" jobs)
```

## qmove

The `qmove` command moves a job to another queue.

Jobs can only be moved from one server to another if they are in the `Q` (queued), `H` (held), or `W` (waiting) states, and only if there are no running subjobs. A job in the Running (`R`), Transiting (`T`), or Exiting (`E`) state cannot be moved.

Example:
```bash
qmove uv@pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz 475337.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz # move job 475337.pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz to a queue uv@pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz
```
## qstat

`qstat` command probes the state of jobs and queues mainly. See sections [Queues in Meta](../../computing/resources/queues)

For detailed options list, see `man qstat`.
