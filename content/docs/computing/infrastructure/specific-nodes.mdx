    The list of nodes on this page is not complete. Normally, the choice of a particular node is not important (sometimes not even desirable), as the choice is done by PBS server according to resource requirements.

## Oven node

Oven (`oven.metacentrum.cz`) is a new special frontend which is available through [oven queue](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/queue/oven@pbs-m1.metacentrum.cz). It is dedicated for non-demanding jobs (control/re-submitting of jobs).

**Parameters:**

- 80 virtual CPUs
- 8 GB memory
- **does not kill** jobs if they exceed requested amount of **CPUs/memory**
- **does kill** jobs if they exceed their **walltime**

**Oven queue:**

- unlike common frontends, `oven` supports job length (walltime) up to one month (720:00:00)
- by default a job gets **only 100 MB memory** (unlike common queues where is the value 400 MB)
- `oven` has a **separated fairshare** (only for control/re-submitting jobs)

**Example:**

This is a basic example how to use oven queue:
```bash
echo "echo hostname | qsub" | qsub -q oven
```
