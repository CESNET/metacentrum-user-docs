title: A comprehensive manual for beginners

*This page is currently under construction and will be completed soon.*

This manual is intended for new users who are unfamiliar with MetaCentrum NGI (National Grid Infrastructure) or any similar infrastructure. However, it isn't easy to summarise the detailed use of the entire infrastructure in a reasonably short guide. The following tutorial aims to provide the minimum necessary knowledge to enable new users to start calculating without any crucial problems as soon as possible.

## If you are confused, please let us know

Sometimes, problems can be too complicated, and error messages can be too cryptic. Please do not hesitate to contact [user support](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/support) as soon as possible and ask for help. We are here to help you. But this is also important for us. It is sometimes necessary to catch inconsistent system behaviour in the act, because it is not possible to detect the cause of an error from the system logs afterwards.

## Available software tools

We provide access to several hundred application tools in thousands of individual modules. For this reason, we are unable to periodically monitor and update all of them, and also, our [list of available tools](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/software/alphabet) only includes those that require some further description. We rely on our users to [inform us](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/support) when a tool needs updating, and we recommend simpler installations in the home directory (with our assistance if required).
