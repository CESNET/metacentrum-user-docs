OnDemand enables users to

- **access files** and directories using graphical File manager,
- **run graphical applications**,
- setup, modify and **run batch jobs**.

Among the pre-installed applications available are Matlab, ANSYS, Jupyter notebook and RStudio server.

## Files

By default, the **Home Directory** link points to storage **brno2**.

## Jobs

### Active jobs

Under this tab you will find list of **all running or queued jobs** on PBS server.

On the contrary to [list of interactive sessions](#my-interactive-sessions), you will see all jobs no matter whether they were submitted via OnDemand interface or otherwise.

By clicking on chosen job, you will find job's details in a similar way as in [Metavo list of your jobs](http://metavo.metacentrum.cz/pbsmon2/person).

At the bottom of the job details table, you can get location to the output files:

### Job composer

Job composer is a GUI wizard to setup a batch job.

## Clusters

The Clusters tab is OnDemand's way to **provide CLI access** to MetaCentrum [frontends](../computing/infrastructure/frontends). Currently there are links to:

- **zuphux.metacentrum.cz**
- **perian.metacentrum.cz**
- **elmo.metacentrum.cz**

Clicking on "Shell access" will open ssh connection in your browser:

## Interactive apps

The "Interactive apps" tab lists all **environments**, **shell access** buttons as well as **graphical software** that can be run from the OnDemand interface.

The "Interactive Apps" tab lists **all graphical software** that can be run as an interactive job.

After it starts, the application runs as an [interactive job](../computing/run-basic-job#interactive-job) on any node within the [MetaCentrum infrastructure](../computing/infrastructure/frontend-storage).

In consequence, the location of home directory (location=`city_XY` in `/storage/city_XY/home/user_123`) can be different for every new run of an application.

In case you need e.g. to upload some data to work on, it may be necessarry to change directory to the right storage.

### Data directory

To store it's own files, OnDemand creates automatically directory `ondemand` in the current **home directory**. You will find there output files, error files and other data for batch jobs submitted from OnDemand interface.

For example, after running the VMD Desktop, all output from the session will be in `~/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/bc_desktop/vmd/output/ONDEMAND_SESSION_ID` directory.

<Callout  type="warn" title="Warning">
    The **ONDEMAND_SESSION_ID** is OnDemand's internal hash for the session, not PBS job ID! It looks like e.g. `9a8b3f2b-0c6d-4cbd-922b-c587f2c2f0fb`.
</Callout>

You can remove the content of OnDemand data directories, or even the `~/ondemand` directory itself, any time you wish.

Every time you run OnDemand, it will first look for existing directory `~/ondemand`. When it does not find any, it creates a new one.

### RStudio issues

As the *home-on-any-storage* feature of OnDemand was causing problems to RStudio users, we applied a workaround for this.

The default location *for RStudio interactive app* is set to `brno2`.

Moreover, users can overwrite this setting by choosin a different location from the drop-down menu:

{/*
After it starts, the application runs as an [interactive job](../computing/run-basic-job#interactive-job) on any node within the [MetaCentrum infrastructure](../computing/infrastructure/frontend-storage).

In consequence, the location of home directory (location=`city_XY` in `/storage/city_XY/home/user_123`) can be different for every new run of an application.

In case you need e.g. to upload some data to work on, it may be necessarry to change directory to the right storage.

**Example: My RStudio run on a node with "plzen1" home, but I want to open a file located in "brno2" storage**

*Username in this example is "melounova"*

*"auto" is an equivalent of "storage" in `/storage/city_XY/home/user_123` path*

![pic](/img/meta/ondemand/app-dir-03.png)

*Choose desired location, in this case "brno2"*

*... finally descend into your home directory.*

## My Interactive Sessions

Under this tab, you will see list of your sessions running in OnDemand.

You can launch or delete running sessions. By closing the tab in the browser you will not loose your session - it can be relaunched, even on another computer, using the blue Launch button if the time reserved for the session is not up yet. 

Next to the 'Launch button is the grey *View only* (sharable link) button which is useful if you want to share live view of your desktop application with colleague.
