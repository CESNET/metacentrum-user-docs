# There are several version of one software, which one shall I use?

There is often more versions of one software installed, e.g.

![pic](sw-which-version-pic-001.png)

If you have no special reason to do otherwise, just use the default module by typing `module add` + the *core name of the module* (without versions etc.), e.g.

![pic](sw-which-version-pic-002.png)
