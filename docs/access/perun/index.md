# Perun

User accounts in MetaCentrum are accessible through [CESNET instance of Perun](https://perun.aai.cesnet.cz).

The Perun service will be useful when you need to:

- **check status** of your account (valid until, expired, blocked...),
- **view groups** you are a member of,
- **view resources and storages** you have acess to.

To get a complete user guide for Perun service, see [Perun documentation](https://perunaai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PERUN/pages/524289/User+Documentation).
