# Galaxy

[Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.cz/) is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational biomedical research. 

Metacentrum runs its own instance of Galaxy server. Proceed as described [in this tutorial on old user wiki](https://wiki.metacentrum.cz/wiki/Galaxy).

# UseGalaxy CZ

Metacentrum offers E-infra and Elixir members access to our [UseGalaxy CZ](https://usegalaxy.cz/) server. 

## Federated Login Options

Metacentrum Galaxy provides two convenient options for logging in:

1. **E-infra:** If you have an E-infra account you should use the designated option on the login page to access Metacentrum Galaxy.

2. **LifeScience:** If you are associated with the LifeScience/Elixir, you can log in using LifeScience AAI.

If you are a member of both institutions, you can link your identities in the Galaxy user settings:

- Go to your Galaxy user settings by clicking on **Preferences** in the **User** tab.
- Under **Preferences**, select **Manage Third-Party Identities**.
- Select the other identity provider and authenticate yourself.

This is recommended especially if you use the same e-mail in both institutions as you will not be able to access your Galaxy account via LifeScience AAI if you sign in with E-infra for the first time and vice versa. 
Overall it is a good idea to link your identities as you might end up in a situation where part of your research data exists on your LifeScience and part on your E-infra account.
