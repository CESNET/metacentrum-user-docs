[CLC Genomics Workbench](https://resources.qiagenbioinformatics.com/manuals/clcgenomicsworkbench/current/index.php?manual=Introduction_CLC_Genomics_Workbench.html) is a powerful solution developed by scientists for scientists to analyze and visualize next generation sequencing (NGS) data.

## Usage

CLCbio Genomics Workbench version 9.5.3: module `CLCgenomicsWB-9.5.3`

- upgrade of a license purchased by Centre CERIT-SC (available for all the MetaVO users) allowing 2 simultaneous runs of the application

CLCbio Genomics Workbench version 7.0: module `CLCgenomicsWB-7.0`

- upgrade of a license purchased by Centre CERIT-SC (available for all the MetaVO users) allowing 2 simultaneous runs of the application

CLCbio Genomics Workbench version 6.5.1: module `CLCgenomicsWB-6.5`

- a license purchased by Centre CERIT-SC (available for all the MetaVO users) allowing 2 simultaneous runs of the application

!!! note
    When requesting a job that will use the application, do not forget to ask the scheduler for starting the job when an application license is available, i.e., submit the job with e.g. qsub -l nodes=1:ppn=X:... -l clcgenomics=1 when requesting a single license to be available.
