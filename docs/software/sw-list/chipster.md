# Chipster 

[Chipster](http://chipster.csc.fi) is a user-friendly analysis software for high-throughput data. It contains over 300 analysis tools for next generation sequencing (NGS), microarray, proteomics and sequence data. Users can save and share automatic analysis workflows, and visualize data interactively using a built-in genome browser and many other visualizations. Chipster's client software uses Java Web Start to install itself automatically, and it connects to computing servers for the actual analysis.
