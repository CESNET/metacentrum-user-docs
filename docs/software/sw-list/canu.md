[Canu](https://canu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a fork of the Celera Assembler designed for high-noise single-molecule sequencing (such as the PacBio RSII or Oxford Nanopore MinION).

## Usage

We recommend using this software with `useGrid=false` parameter because of its strange behavior using PBS.
