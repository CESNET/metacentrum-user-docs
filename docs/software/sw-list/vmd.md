[VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) is a software designed for modeling, visualization, and analysis of biological systems such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure.

## OnDemand

VMD Desktop can be run in a browser as [OnDemand service](https://ondemand.metacentrum.cz). This is the most straighforward and simplest way.

## Remote desktop 

Using [Remote desktop](../../software/graphical-access), VMD can be also run from a module.

This option is recommended to advanced users or as a fallback option in case OnDemand service is down.
